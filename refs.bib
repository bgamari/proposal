abstract = {The physiological role(s) played by G-quadruplexes renders these 'non-canonical' DNA secondary structures interesting new targets for therapeutic intervention. In particular, the search for ligands for selective recognition and stabilization of G-quadruplex arrangements has led to a number of novel targeted agents. An interesting approach is represented by the use of metal-complexes, their binding to DNA being modulated by ligand and metal ion nature, and by complex stoichiometry. In this work we characterized thermodynamically and stereochemically the interactions of a Ni(II) bis-phenanthroline derivative with telomeric G-quadruplex sequences using calorimetric, chiroptical and NMR techniques. We employed three strictly related sequences based on the human telomeric repeat, namely Tel22, Tel26 and wtTel26, which assume distinct conformations in potassium containing solutions. We were able to monitor specific enthalpy/entropy changes according to the structural features of the target telomeric sequence and to dissect the binding process into distinct events. Interestingly, temperature effects turned out to be prominent both in terms of binding stoichiometry and $\Delta$H/$\Delta$S contributions, while the final G-quadruplex-metal complex architecture tended to merge for the examined sequences. These results underline the critical choice of experimental conditions and DNA sequence for practical use of thermodynamic data in the rational development of effective G-quadruplex binders.},

abstract = {G-quadruplex structures formed by DNA at the human telomeres are attractive anticancer targets. Human telomeric sequences can adopt a diverse range of intramolecular G-quadruplex conformations: a parallel-stranded conformation was observed in the crystalline state, while at least four other forms were seen in K(+) solution, raising the question of which conformation is favored in crowded cellular environment. Here, we report the first NMR structure of a human telomeric G-quadruplex in crowded solution. We show that four different G-quadruplex conformations are converted to a propeller-type parallel-stranded G-quadruplex in K(+)-containing crowded solution due to water depletion. This study also reveals the formation of a new higher-order G-quadruplex structure under molecular crowding conditions. Our molecular dynamics simulations of solvent distribution provide insights at molecular level on the formation of parallel-stranded G-quadruplex in environment depleted of water. These results regarding human telomeric DNA can be extended to oncogenic promoters and other genomic G-rich sequences.},

abstract = {The triplet-state characteristics of the Cy5 molecule related to trans-cis isomerization are investigated by means of ensemble and single molecule measurements. Cy5 has been used frequently in the past 10 years in single molecule spectroscopic applications, e.g., as a probe or fluorescence resonance energy transfer acceptor in large biomolecules. However, the unknown spectral properties of the triplet state and the lack of knowledge on the photoisomerization do not allow us to interpret precisely the unexpected single molecule behaviors. This limits the application of Cy5. The laser photolysis experiments demonstrate that the trans triplet state of Cy5 absorbs about 625 nm, the cis ground state absorbs about 690 nm, and the cis triplet state also absorbs about 690 nm. In other words, the T1-Tn absorptions largely overlap the ground-state absorptions for both trans and cis isomers, respectively. Furthermore, the observation of the cis triplet state indicates an important isomerization pathway from the trans-S1 state to the cis-T1 state upon excitation. The detailed spectra presented in this article let us clearly interpret the exact mechanisms responsible for several important and unexpected photophysical behaviors of single Cy5 molecules such as reverse intersystem crossing (RISC), the observation of dim states with a lower emission intensity and slightly red-shifted fluorescence, and unusual energy transfer from donor molecules to dark Cy5 molecules acting as acceptors in single molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) measurements. Spectral results show that the dim state in the single molecule fluorescence intensity time traces originated from cis-Cy5 because of a lower excitation rate, resulting from the red-shifted ground-state absorption of cis-Cy5 compared to that of the trans-Cy5.},

abstract = {The physical forces that underlie the exclusion of solutes from macromolecular surfaces can be probed in a similar way as the measurement of forces between macromolecules in condensed arrays using the osmotic stress technique and x-ray scattering. We report here the dependence of alcohol exclusion or, equivalently, the preferential hydration of DNA on the spacing between helices in condensed arrays. The actual forces describing exclusion are quite different from the commonly assumed steric crowding coupled with weak binding. For a set of 12 nonpolar alcohols, exclusion is due to repulsive hydration interactions with the charged DNA surface. Exclusion amplitudes do not depend simply on size, but rather on the balance between alkyl carbons and hydroxyl oxygens. Polyols are included at very close spacings. The distance dependence of polyol inclusion, however, is quite different from nonpolar alcohol exclusion, suggesting the underlying mechanism of interaction is different.},

abstract = {We have analyzed and compared the molecular structures and dynamics of DNA duplexes containing a nick or a gap of one nucleotide where the base in front of the gap is a guanine. The continuous strand has the sequence 5'(CAGAGTCXCTGGCTC) where the residue X is absent for the nick, 14-mer, and where it is a G residue for the gap. Duplexes were formed with the two corresponding 7-mers. Neither of these is phosphorylated adjacent at the nick site, but it is a good model for a single strand break. For the nick structure, the quantitative NMR data show that the global conformation is very close to canonical B-form DNA, but it displays enhanced local flexibility. For the gap structure, we observe only one species in which the extra G is well stacked into the helix. The two half-helices around this residue also show a B-form conformation. As with the nick duplex, the adjacent G imino protons show enhanced exchange with solvent. The gap does not close completely. Using distance constraints, MD calculations show that the nick conformation is very close to a duplex with no lesion but is indeed more flexible in the central part. The gapped structure shows two families of conformations. One is close to B-DNA, the other is significantly kinked at the gap which reduces the size of the cavity. We observe a spine of hydration within the cavities, similar, but of different geometry in the two cases.},

abstract = {Bulges represent one of the most common non-helical elements in RNA, often displaying a strong degree of phylogenetic conservation, both in location and sequence, within larger RNA molecules. Thus, knowledge of the conformation and flexibility of RNA bulges is an important prerequisite for understanding the rules governing the formation of tertiary structure within the larger molecules. In the current investigation, the magnitudes of the bends induced in a 148 base-pair duplex RNA molecule by single, centrally located bulges of varying size (n = 1 to 6) and base composition (An and Un series) have been determined through the use of transient electric birefringence (TEB). The TEB approach is highly sensitive to the changes in the global shape of RNA (or DNA) helices that accompany the introduction of points of bending or flexibility near the center of the helix. In the current instance, bulge angles deduced from TEB measurements ranged from approximately 7 degrees to approximately 93 degrees, with the angle increasing with increasing n for both An and Un series. For both An and Un series in the absence of Mg2+, the angle increment per added nucleotide varied from approximately 20 degrees to approximately 8 degrees as n increased from 1 to 6. These angle increments remained unchanged for the An series in the presence of Mg2+; however, the angle increments for the Un series were reduced by a factor of 2 for all values of n. Thus the current observations have identified structural transitions in one of the simplest non-helical elements in RNA, transitions that are dependent on both sequence and counterion valence. Finally, the measured bend angles are strongly correlated with the degree of reduction in electrophoretic mobility of bulge-containing RNA helices. The observed correlation was used to obtain a semi-empirical relationship between bend angle and mobility in order that additional angles might be assigned, by interpolation, through the use of gel data alone.},

abstract = {An analytic solution of the F\"{o}rster energy transfer problem in two dimensions is presented for the case in which the orientation factor is independent of the donor-acceptor distance, and both the donors and acceptors are randomly distributed in a plane. A general solution based on the method of F\"{o}rster is possible since all distances are measured in units of R0. The analytic solution is extended to the cases of donors embedded in structures that exclude acceptors, and donors that bind acceptors. The validity of the analytic solutions is demonstrated by comparison with numerical simulation calculations. Numerical approximations to the exact solutions are given for ease of computation. Specific applications to the case of fluorescence quenching of a membrane-bound donor by membrane-bound acceptors are presented.},

abstract = {Practical and cost-effective circuitry with high sensitivity has been developed to measure a small capacitance using current compensation method. The circuitry uses an electronic switch to periodically connect or separate the capacitor under test (C(x)) from a reference capacitor (C(r)). When C(x) is connected in parallel with C(r) the total capacitance becomes C(x)+C(r). On the other hand, as C(x) is separated from C(r), the total capacitance is only C(r). This periodic change of the capacitance generates a periodic square-wave output with an amplitude in proportion to the capacitance of C(x). A high sensitivity of DeltaV/DeltaC=202.2 mV/pF has been achieved, making the circuitry a powerful tool in measuring small capacitances. Three applications have been performed to present its capability: (a) displacement, (b) height of liquid, and (c) angle of tilt. The experimental results demonstrate the performance of the circuitry.},

abstract = {We present a method for the analysis of optical single molecule emission data that exhibit discrete intensity jumps. This new method uses a generalized likelihood ratio test that determines the location of an intensity change point based on individual photon arrival times. This test is applied recursively to an entire single molecule intensity trajectory, thus finding each change points. Expectation-maximization clustering and the Bayesian information criterion is then used for accurate determination of the true number of states accessible to the system. This procedure allows rigorous and quantitative determination of intensity change points without the artificial time resolution limitations that arise from binning and thresholding.},

The determination of I0 (q) and possible sources of experimental uncertainties (q) of chains without excluded volume is given. These analytical theories are compared to Monte-Carlo simula- tions of semiflexible chains without excluded volume. It is shown that analytical expressions given by Pedersen and Schurtenberger (Macromolecules 29, 7602 (1996); method 2) provides the best description of the I0 are discussed in detail.

One of these is the fluctuation theorem, which places conditions on the entropy production probability distribution of nonequilibrium systems. Another recently discovered far from equilibrium expression relates nonequilibrium measurements of the work done on a system to equilibrium free energy differences. In this paper, we derive a generalized version of the fluctuation theorem for stochastic, microscopically reversible dynamics. Invoking this generalized theorem provides a succinct proof of the nonequilibrium work relation.},

abstract = {We consider the analysis of a class of experiments in which the number of photons in consecutive time intervals is recorded. Sequence of photon counts or, alternatively, of FRET efficiencies can be studied using likelihood-based methods. For a kinetic model of the conformational dynamics and state-dependent Poisson photon statistics, the formalism to calculate the exact likelihood that this model describes such sequences of photons or FRET efficiencies is developed. Explicit analytic expressions for the likelihood function for a two-state kinetic model are provided. The important special case when conformational dynamics are so slow that at most a single transition occurs in a time bin is considered. By making a series of approximations, we eventually recover the likelihood function used in hidden Markov models. In this way, not only is insight gained into the range of validity of this procedure, but also an improved likelihood function can be obtained.},

Herein, we report guided chemical synthesis of small molecules capable of binding to DNA bulges by virtue of their unique (spirocyclic) geometry. The agents, modeled on a natural product congener, show pronounced selectivity for specific bulged motifs and are able to enhance slipped DNA synthesis, a hallmark functional assay of bulge binding. Significantly, bulge-agent complexes demonstrate characteristic fluorescent signatures depending on bulge and flanking sequence in the oligo. It is anticipated that these signature patterns can be harnessed as molecular probes of bulged hotspots in DNA and RNA.},

abstract = {A new numerical analysis method for experimental single-pair fluorescence resonance energy transfer (sp-FRET) data is proposed. In this method, every single data point was plotted in a style of a cumulative distribution function and dedicated to curve-fitting analysis, so that the analysis does not depend on bin size. A series of numerical simulations showed that this analysis has a more efficient and accurate resolvability of components than a fitting method based on Gaussian functions to a histogram plot. A simulated data based on experimental FRET distributions were also used to discuss the fitting errors of this method. The proposed method was applied to sp-FRET experiments of doubly dye-labeled double-strand DNA with a short sequence. Mixtures of up to three species were analyzed, and the contributions up to four subpopulations were successfully resolved.},

abstract = {Knowledge of the mechanical properties of double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) is essential to understand the role of dsDNA looping in gene regulation and the mechanochemistry of molecular machines that operate on dsDNA. Here, we use a newly developed tool, force sensors with optical readout, to measure the forces inside short, strained loops composed of both dsDNA and single-stranded DNA. By varying the length of the loops and their proportion of dsDNA, it was possible to vary their internal forces from 1 pN to >20 pN. Surprisingly, internal loop forces changed erratically as the amount of dsDNA was increased for a given loop length, with the effect most notable in the smallest loop (57 nucleotides). Monte Carlo simulations based on the helical wormlike chain model accurately predict internal forces when more than half of the loop is dsDNA but fail otherwise. Mismatches engineered into the double-stranded regions increased flexibility, suggesting that Watson-Crick basepaired dsDNA can withstand high compressive forces without recourse to multibase melts. Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy further excluded transient melting (microsecond to millisecond duration) as a mechanism for relief of compressive forces in the tested dsDNAs. DNA loops with integrated force sensors may allow the comprehensive mapping of the elasticity of short dsDNAs as a function of both sequence and salt.},

The technique involves the irradiation of isolated single, mulitchromophoric, conjugated polymer molecules by a repetitive sequence of variable-intensity microsecond time scale excitation pulses. The fluorescence intensity is synchronously time-averaged for thousands of cycles of the pulse sequence to yield a high signal-to-noise fluorescence transient on the microsecond time scale. The transient can be analyzed with kinetic models to obtain quantitative information about the kinetics of triplet-triplet exciton annihilation and the quenching of singlet excitons by triplet excitons in conjugated polymers.},

abstract = {Whilst DNA spends much of its time in the double-stranded form, frequently in storage, wrapped around histones and packaged as chromatin, it can also form other complex structures, which may play a role in natural regulation and gene control. These alternative structures therefore also present an interesting novel series of targets for artificial intervention, and so may lead to novel therapeutics. In this review, I describe the current understanding of how genomic and bioinformatics studies may be used to understand the roles that one such structure, the four-stranded guanine-rich G-quadruplex, may play in the genome, and outline how these may be considered as targets for intervention. I will also describe recent work looking at RNA G-quadruplexes, and the biological roles they may play.},

abstract = {Stability of duplex DNA with respect to separation of complementary strands is crucial for DNA executing its major functions in the cell and it also plays a central role in major biotechnology applications of DNA: DNA sequencing, polymerase chain reaction, and DNA microarrays. Two types of interaction are well known to contribute to DNA stability: stacking between adjacent base-pairs and pairing between complementary bases. However, their contribution into the duplex stability is yet to be determined. Now we fill this fundamental gap in our knowledge of the DNA double helix. We have prepared a series of 32, 300 bp-long DNA fragments with solitary nicks in the same position differing only in base-pairs flanking the nick. Electrophoretic mobility of these fragments in the gel has been studied. Assuming the equilibrium between stacked and unstacked conformations at the nick site, all 32 stacking free energy parameters have been obtained. Only ten of them are essential and they govern the stacking interactions between adjacent base-pairs in intact DNA double helix. A full set of DNA stacking parameters has been determined for the first time. From these data and from a well-known dependence of DNA melting temperature on G.C content, the contribution of base-pairing into duplex stability has been estimated. The obtained energy parameters of the DNA double helix are of paramount importance for understanding sequence-dependent DNA flexibility and for numerous biotechnology applications.},

abstract = {By exerting mechanical force, it is possible to unfold/refold RNA molecules one at a time. In a small range of forces, an RNA molecule can hop between the folded and the unfolded state with force-dependent kinetic rates. Here, we introduce a mesoscopic model to analyze the hopping kinetics of RNA hairpins in an optical tweezers setup. The model includes different elements of the experimental setup (beads, handles, and RNA sequence) and limitations of the instrument (time lag of the force-feedback mechanism and finite bandwidth of data acquisition). We investigated the influence of the instrument on the measured hopping rates. Results from the model are in good agreement with the experiments reported in the companion article. The comparison between theory and experiments allowed us to infer the values of the intrinsic molecular rates of the RNA hairpin alone and to search for the optimal experimental conditions to do the measurements. We conclude that the longest handles and softest traps that allow detection of the folding/unfolding signal (handles approximately 5-10 Kbp and traps approximately 0.03 pN/nm) represent the best conditions to obtain the intrinsic molecular rates. The methodology and rationale presented here can be applied to other experimental setups and other molecules.},

abstract = {There is currently great interest in determining physical parameters, e.g. fluorescence lifetime, of individual molecules that inform on environmental conditions, whilst avoiding the artefacts of ensemble averaging. Protein interactions, molecular dynamics and sub-species can all be studied. In a burst integrated fluorescence lifetime (BIFL) experiment, identification of fluorescent bursts from single molecules above background detection is a problem. This paper presents a Bayesian method for burst identification based on model selection and demonstrates the detection of bursts consisting of 10\% signal amplitude. The method also estimates the fluorescence lifetime (and its error) from the burst data.},

abstract = {One of the fundamental properties of the RNA helix is its intrinsic resistance to bend- or twist-deformations. Results of a variety of physical measurements point to a persistence length of 700-800 A for double-stranded RNA in the presence of magnesium cations, approximately 1.5-2.0-fold larger than the corresponding value for DNA. Although helix flexibility represents an important, quantifiable measure of the forces of interaction within the helix, it must also be considered in describing conformational variation of nonhelix elements (e.g. internal loops, branches), since the latter always reflect the properties of the flanking helices; that is, such elements are never completely rigid. For one important element of tertiary structure, namely, the core of yeast tRNAPhe, the above consideration has led to the conclusion that the core is not substantially more flexible than an equivalent length of pure helix.},

abstract = {Recent advances in photobleaching and blinking prevention have aided the advancement of single-molecule and super-resolution fluorescence microscopy. However, a common mechanism of the action of antifading agents such as Trolox is still missing. In this communication we present evidence that Trolox acts in accordance with a mechanism that involves triplet quenching through electron transfer and subsequent recovery of the resulting radical ion by the complementary redox reaction. The required oxidant for this unifying mechanism based on a reducing and oxidizing system (ROXS) is formed via (photo-) reaction with molecular oxygen. We present evidence that this oxidized form is a quinone derivative of Trolox with strong oxidizing properties. These findings shed light on many contradicting results regarding the action of antifading agents and might lead to a common mechanistic understanding of photobleaching and its prevention. Finally, a recipe on the proper use of Trolox as an antifading agent is provided.},

abstract = {Internal friction, which reflects the "roughness" of the energy landscape, plays an important role for proteins by modulating the dynamics of their folding and other conformational changes. However, the experimental quantification of internal friction and its contribution to folding dynamics has remained challenging. Here we use the combination of single-molecule F\"{o}rster resonance energy transfer, nanosecond fluorescence correlation spectroscopy, and microfluidic mixing to determine the reconfiguration times of unfolded proteins and investigate the mechanisms of internal friction contributing to their dynamics. Using concepts from polymer dynamics, we determine internal friction with three complementary, largely independent, and consistent approaches as an additive contribution to the reconfiguration time of the unfolded state. We find that the magnitude of internal friction correlates with the compactness of the unfolded protein: its contribution dominates the reconfiguration time of approximately 100 ns of the compact unfolded state of a small cold shock protein under native conditions, but decreases for more expanded chains, and approaches zero both at high denaturant concentrations and in intrinsically disordered proteins that are expanded due to intramolecular charge repulsion. Our results suggest that internal friction in the unfolded state will be particularly relevant for the kinetics of proteins that fold in the microsecond range or faster. The low internal friction in expanded intrinsically disordered proteins may have implications for the dynamics of their interactions with cellular binding partners.},

abstract = {Time series data provided by single-molecule F\"{o}rster resonance energy transfer (smFRET) experiments offer the opportunity to infer not only model parameters describing molecular complexes, e.g., rate constants, but also information about the model itself, e.g., the number of conformational states. Resolving whether such states exist or how many of them exist requires a careful approach to the problem of model selection, here meaning discrimination among models with differing numbers of states. The most straightforward approach to model selection generalizes the common idea of maximum likelihood--selecting the most likely parameter values--to maximum evidence: selecting the most likely model. In either case, such an inference presents a tremendous computational challenge, which we here address by exploiting an approximation technique termed variational Bayesian expectation maximization. We demonstrate how this technique can be applied to temporal data such as smFRET time series; show superior statistical consistency relative to the maximum likelihood approach; compare its performance on smFRET data generated from experiments on the ribosome; and illustrate how model selection in such probabilistic or generative modeling can facilitate analysis of closely related temporal data currently prevalent in biophysics. Source code used in this analysis, including a graphical user interface, is available open source via http://vbFRET.sourceforge.net.},

abstract = {One of the fundamental properties of the RNA helix is its intrinsic resistance to bend- or twist-deformations. Results of a variety of physical measurements point to a persistence length of 700-800 A for double-stranded RNA in the presence of magnesium cations, approximately 1.5-2.0-fold larger than the corresponding value for DNA. Although helix flexibility represents an important, quantifiable measure of the forces of interaction within the helix, it must also be considered in describing conformational variation of nonhelix elements (e.g. internal loops, branches), since the latter always reflect the properties of the flanking helices; that is, such elements are never completely rigid. For one important element of tertiary structure, namely, the core of yeast tRNAPhe, the above consideration has led to the conclusion that the core is not substantially more flexible than an equivalent length of pure helix.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Co-expression of proteins is generally achieved by introducing two (or more) independent plasmids into cells, each driving the expression of a different protein of interest. However, the relative expression levels may vary strongly between individual cells and cannot be controlled. Ideally, co-expression occurs at a defined ratio, which is constant among cells. This feature is of particular importance for quantitative single cell studies, especially those employing bimolecular F\"{o}rster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) sensors.

METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Four co-expression strategies based on co-transfection, a dual promotor plasmid, an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) and a viral 2A peptide were selected. Co-expression of two spectrally separable fluorescent proteins in single living cells was quantified. It is demonstrated that the 2A peptide strategy can be used for robust equimolar co-expression, while the IRES sequence allows expression of two proteins at a ratio of approximately 3:1. Combined 2A and IRES elements were used for the construction of a single plasmid that drives expression of three individual proteins, which generates a FRET sensor for measuring heterotrimeric G-protein activation. The plasmid drives co-expression of donor and acceptor tagged subunits, with reduced heterogeneity, and can be used to measure G-protein activation in single living cells.

CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Quantitative co-expression of two or more proteins can be achieved with little cell-to-cell variability. This finding enables reliable co-expression of donor and acceptor tagged proteins for FRET studies, which is of particular importance for the development of novel bimolecular sensors that can be expressed from single plasmid.},

abstract = {Probability distribution analysis (PDA) [M. Antonik et al., J. Phys. Chem. B 2006, 110, 6970] allows one to quantitatively analyze single-molecule (SM) data obtained in Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET) or fluorescence polarization experiments. By taking explicitly background and shot noise contributions into account, PDA accurately predicts the shape of one-dimensional histograms of various parameters, such as FRET efficiency or fluorescence anisotropy. In order to describe complex experimental SM-FRET or polarization data obtained for systems consisting of multiple non-interconverting fluorescent states, several extensions to the PDA theory are presented. Effects of brightness variations and multiple-molecule events are considered independently of the detection volume parameters by using only the overall experimental signal intensity distribution. The extended PDA theory can now be applied to analyze any mixture, by using any a priori model or a model-free deconvolution approach based on the maximum entropy method (MEM). The accuracy of the analysis and the number of free parameters are limited only by data quality. Correction of the PDA model function for the presence of multiple-molecule events allows one to measure at high SM concentrations to avoid artifacts due to a very long measurement time. Tools such as MEM and combined mean donor fluorescence lifetime analysis have been developed to distinguish whether extra broadening of PDA histograms could be attributed to structural heterogeneities or dye artifacts. In this way, an ultimate resolution in FRET experiments in the range of a few Angstrom is achieved which allows for molecular Angstrom optics distinguishing between a set of fixed distances and a distribution of distances. The extended theory is verified by analyzing simulations and experimental data.},

abstract = {We use the cyclization of small DNA molecules, approximately 200 bp in length, to study conformational properties of DNA fragments with single-stranded gaps. The approach is extremely sensitive to DNA conformational properties and, being complemented by computations, allows a very accurate determination of the fragment's conformational parameters. Sequence-specific nicking endonucleases are used to create the 4-nt-long gap. We determined the bending rigidity of the single-stranded region in the gapped DNA. We found that the gap of 4 nt in length makes all torsional orientations of DNA ends equally probable. Our results also show that the gap has isotropic bending rigidity. This makes it very attractive to use gapped DNA in the cyclization experiments to determine DNA conformational properties, since the gap eliminates oscillations of the cyclization efficiency with the DNA length. As a result, the number of measurements is greatly reduced in the approach, and the analysis of the data is greatly simplified. We have verified our approach on DNA fragments containing well-characterized intrinsic bends caused by A-tracts. The obtained experimental results and theoretical analysis demonstrate that gapped-DNA cyclization is an exceedingly sensitive and accurate approach for the determination of DNA bending.},

@article{Drzymala1999,
abstract = {The ice/water interface is a common and important part of many biological, environmental, and technological systems. In contrast to its importance, the system has not been extensively studied and is not well understood. Therefore, in this paper the properties of the H(2)O ice/water and D(2)O ice/water interfaces were investigated. Although the zeta potential vs pH data points were significantly scattered, it was determined that the isoelectric point (iep) of D(2)O ice particles in water at 3.5 degrees C containing 10(-3) M NaCl occurs at about pH 3.0. The negative values of the zeta potential, calculated from the electrophoretic mobility, seem to decrease with decreasing content of NaCl, while the iep shifts to a higher pH. The point of zero charge (pzc) of D(2)O ice and H(2)O ice, determined by changes in pH of 10(-4) M NaCl aqueous solution at 0.5 degrees C after the ice particle addition, was found to be very different from the iep and equal to pH 7.0 +/- 0.5. The shift of the iep with NaCl concentration and the difference in the positions of the iep and pzc on the pH scale point to complex specific adsorption of ions at the interface. Interestingly, similar values of iep and pzc were found for very different systems, such as hydrophilic ice and highly hydrophobic hexadecane droplets in water. A comparison of the zeta potential vs pH curves for hydrophilic ice and hydrophobic materials that do not possess dissociative functional groups at the interface (diamond, air bubbles, bacteria, and hexadecane) indicated that all of them have an iep near pH 3.5. These results indicate that the zeta potential and surface charge data alone cannot be used to delineate the electrochemical properties of a given water/moiety interface because similar electrical properties do not necessary mean a similar structure of the interfacial region. A good example is the aliphatic hydrocarbon/water interface in comparison to the ice/water interface. Although the experiments were carried out with care, both the zeta potential, measured with a precise ZetaPlus meter, and DeltapH values (a measure of surface charge) vs pH were significantly scattered, and the origin of dissemination of the data points was not established. Differently charged ice particles and not fully equilibrium conditions at the ice/water interface may have been responsible for the dissemination of the data. Copyright 1999 Academic Press.},

abstract = {Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) between a donor (D) and an acceptor (A) at the single-molecule level currently provides qualitative information about distance, and quantitative information about kinetics of distance changes. Here, we used the sorting ability of confocal microscopy equipped with alternating-laser excitation (ALEX) to measure accurate FRET efficiencies and distances from single molecules, using corrections that account for cross-talk terms that contaminate the FRET-induced signal, and for differences in the detection efficiency and quantum yield of the probes. ALEX yields accurate FRET independent of instrumental factors, such as excitation intensity or detector alignment. Using DNA fragments, we showed that ALEX-based distances agree well with predictions from a cylindrical model of DNA; ALEX-based distances fit better to theory than distances obtained at the ensemble level. Distance measurements within transcription complexes agreed well with ensemble-FRET measurements, and with structural models based on ensemble-FRET and x-ray crystallography. ALEX can benefit structural analysis of biomolecules, especially when such molecules are inaccessible to conventional structural methods due to heterogeneity or transient nature.},

abstract = {The mechanics of DNA bending on intermediate length scales (5-100 nm) plays a key role in many cellular processes, and is also important in the fabrication of artificial DNA structures, but previous experimental studies of DNA mechanics have focused on longer length scales than these. We use high-resolution atomic force microscopy on individual DNA molecules to obtain a direct measurement of the bending energy function appropriate for scales down to 5 nm. Our measurements imply that the elastic energy of highly bent DNA conformations is lower than predicted by classical elasticity models such as the worm-like chain (WLC) model. For example, we found that on short length scales, spontaneous large-angle bends are many times more prevalent than predicted by the WLC model. We test our data and model with an interlocking set of consistency checks. Our analysis also shows how our model is compatible with previous experiments, which have sometimes been viewed as confirming the WLC.},

abstract = {The kink-turn (k-turn), a new RNA structural motif found in the spliceosome and the ribosome, serves as a specific protein recognition element and as a structural building block. While the structure of the spliceosomal U4 snRNA k-turn/15.5K complex is known from a crystal structure, it is unclear whether the k-turn also exists in this folded conformation in the free U4 snRNA. Thus, we investigated the U4 snRNA k-turn by single-molecule FRET measurements in the absence and presence of the 15.5K protein and its dependence on the Na+ and Mg2+ ion concentration. We show that the unfolded U4 snRNA k-turn introduces a kink of 85° ± 15° in an RNA double helix. While Na+ and Mg2+ ions induce this more open conformation of the k-turn, binding of the 15.5K protein was found to induce the tightly kinked conformation in the RNA that increases the kink to 52° ± 15°. By comparison of the measured FRET distances with a computer-modeled structure, we show that this strong kink is due to the k-turn motif adopting its folded conformation. Thus, in the free U4 snRNA, the k-turn exists only in an unfolded conformation, and its folding is induced by binding of the 15.5K protein.},

abstract = {Over the past few years, it has become increasingly apparent that double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) plays a far greater role in the life cycle of a cell than previously expected. Numerous proteins, including helicases, polymerases, and nucleases interact specifically with the double helix of dsRNA. To understand the detailed nature of these dsRNA-protein interactions, the (bio)chemical, electrostatic, and mechanical properties of dsRNA need to be fully characterized. We present measurements of the persistence length of dsRNA using two different single-molecule techniques: magnetic tweezers and atomic force microscopy. We deduce a mean persistence length for long dsRNA molecules of 63.8 +/- 0.7 nm from force-extension measurements with the magnetic tweezers. We present atomic force microscopy images of dsRNA and demonstrate a new method for analyzing these, which yields an independent, yet consistent value of 62 +/- 2 nm for the persistence length. The introduction of these single-molecule techniques for dsRNA analysis opens the way for real-time, quantitative analysis of dsRNA-protein interactions.},

This feature makes FRET a powerful tool to study complicated biological assemblies. In this report we review the applications of FRET to studies of transcription initiation by Escherichia coli RNA polymerase. The versatility of FRET for studies of a large macromolecular assembly such as RNA polymerase is illustrated by examples of using FRET to address several different aspects of transcription initiation by polymerase. FRET has been used to determine the architecture of polymerase, its complex with single-stranded DNA, and the conformation of promoter fragment bound to polymerase. FRET has been also used as a binding assay to determine the thermodynamics of promoter DNA fragment binding to the polymerase. Functional conformational changes in the specificity subunit of polymerase responsible for the modulation of the promoter binding activity of the enzyme and the mechanistic aspects of the transition from the initiation to the elongation complex were also investigated.},

The fluorescence efficiency and lifetime ofCy3 increase in the presence of all four nucleoside monophosphates. This behavior correlates with an increase in the activation energy for photoisomerization and a approximately 4 nm red shift in the fluorescence spectrum. Changes are more dramatic for the purines (dAMP, dGMP) than the pyrimidines(dCMP, dTMP), and for the nonsulfonated cyanine(DiIC2(3)) than the sulfonated dye (Cy3-SE). These results are consistent with a model in which Cy3-nucleoside pi-pi interactions decrease the efficiency of photoisomerization,increasing the efficiency of fluorescence.},

abstract = {Experimental variables of optical tweezers instrumentation that affect RNA folding/unfolding kinetics were investigated. A model RNA hairpin, P5ab, was attached to two micron-sized beads through hybrid RNA/DNA handles; one bead was trapped by dual-beam lasers and the other was held by a micropipette. Several experimental variables were changed while measuring the unfolding/refolding kinetics, including handle lengths, trap stiffness, and modes of force applied to the molecule. In constant-force mode where the tension applied to the RNA was maintained through feedback control, the measured rate coefficients varied within 40\% when the handle lengths were changed by 10-fold (1.1-10.2 Kbp); they increased by two- to threefold when the trap stiffness was lowered to one-third (from 0.1 to 0.035 pN/nm). In the passive mode, without feedback control and where the force applied to the RNA varied in response to the end-to-end distance change of the tether, the RNA hopped between a high-force folded-state and a low-force unfolded-state. In this mode, the rates increased up to twofold with longer handles or softer traps. Overall, the measured rates remained with the same order-of-magnitude over the wide range of conditions studied. In the companion article on pages 3010-3021, we analyze how the measured kinetics parameters differ from the intrinsic molecular rates of the RNA, and thus how to obtain the molecular rates.},

Bayesian methods are developed to identify fluorophore photoblinks in the time trajectories. Simulated data are used to quantify the improvement in static and dynamic data analysis. Application of the method to experimental smFRET data shows that it distinguishes photoblinks from large shifts in smFRET efficiency while maintaining the important advantage of an unbiased approach. Known sources of experimental noise are examined and quantified as a means to remove their contributions via soft thresholding of wavelet coefficients. A wavelet decomposition algorithm is described, and thresholds are produced through the knowledge of noise parameters in the discrete-time photon signals. Reconstruction of the signals from thresholded coefficients produces signals that contain noise arising only from unquantifiable parameters. The method is applied to simulated and observed smFRET data, and it is found that the denoised data retain their underlying dynamic properties, but with increased resolution.},

abstract = {Protein-bound duplex DNA is often bent or kinked. Yet, quantification of intrinsic DNA bending that might lead to such protein interactions remains enigmatic. DNA cyclization experiments have indicated that DNA may form sharp bends more easily than predicted by the established worm-like chain (WLC) model. One proposed explanation suggests that local melting of a few base pairs introduces flexible hinges. We have expanded this model to incorporate sequence and temperature dependence of the local melting, and tested it for three sequences at temperatures from 23 degrees C to 42 degrees C. We find that small melted bubbles are significantly more flexible than double-stranded DNA and can alter DNA flexibility at physiological temperatures. However, these bubbles are not flexible enough to explain the recently observed very sharp bends in DNA.},

An adjustable formula, modeling the spatial brightness distribution, and the technique of generating functions for calculation of theoretical photon count number distributions serve as the two cornerstones of the methodology. The method permits the simultaneous determination of concentrations and specific brightness values of a number of individual fluorescent species in solution. Accordingly, we present an extremely sensitive tool to monitor the interaction of fluorescently labeled molecules or other microparticles with their respective biological counterparts that should find a wide application in life sciences, medicine, and drug discovery. Its potential is demonstrated by studying the hybridization of 5'-(6-carboxytetramethylrhodamine)-labeled and nonlabeled complementary oligonucleotides and the subsequent cleavage of the DNA hybrids by restriction enzymes.},

abstract = {Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) can resolve the intrinsic fast-blinking kinetics (FBKs) of fluorescent molecules that occur on the order of microseconds. These FBKs can be heavily influenced by the microenvironments in which the fluorescent molecules are contained. In this work, FCS is used to monitor the dynamics of fluorescence emission from Cy5 labeled on DNA probes. We found that the FBKs of Cy5 can be tuned by having more or less unpaired guanines (upG) and thymines (upT) around the Cy5 dye. The observed FBKs of Cy5 are found to predominantly originate from the isomerization and back-isomerization processes of Cy5, and Cy5-nucleobase interactions are shown to slow down these processes. These findings lead to a more precise quantification of DNA hybridization using FCS analysis, in which the FBKs play a major role rather than the diffusion kinetics. We further show that the alterations of the FBKs of Cy5 on probe hybridization can be used to differentiate DNA targets with single-nucleotide differences. This discrimination relies on the design of a probe-target-probe DNA three-way-junction, whose basepairing configuration can be altered as a consequence of a single-nucleotide substitution on the target. Reconfiguration of the three-way-junction alters the Cy5-upG or Cy5-upT interactions, therefore resulting in a measurable change in Cy5 FBKs. Detection of single-nucleotide variations within a sequence selected from the Kras gene is carried out to validate the concept of this new method.},

abstract = {A 16-mer deoxyribonucleotide was labeled at the 5'-end with x-rhodamine and at the 3'-end with fluorescein. F\"{o}rster resonance energy transfer was used to determine the distribution, P(R), of donor-acceptor distances for the oligomer in three duplex structures (hybridized to complementary strands having 10, 16, and 24 bases) and as a single strand; measurements were made in 0.18 M NaCl and 1 M KCl solutions. These distributions were derived from lifetime measurements made in the frequency domain using a multiharmonic frequency phase fluorometer. The fluorescein fluorescence decay for each duplex structure was fit very well with P(R) modeled as a shifted Gaussian. On the basis of the mean donor-acceptor distance, these structures for the 16-mer and the 24-mer were consistent with that of B-DNA. For the 16-mer duplex in 0.18 M NaCl, the distribution was centered at 68.4 A with sigma = 6.4 A. For the 10-mer duplex, the mean donor-acceptor distance, 61.8 A, is much larger than that for a structure with the fluorophores extended perpendicular to the helix axis. For the single-strand data, various high-quality fits yielded physically unreasonable distributions or could not accurately account for the acceptor response. Considered analyses suggested that the single-strand distribution was best represented by a shifted Gaussian, with R = 51.5 A and sigma = 10.0 A in 0.18 M NaCl. In all cases, sigma increased and R decreased in 1 M KCl relative to their values in 0.18 M NaCl, consistent with the increased flexibility of the polymer.},

abstract = {Photon trajectories from single molecule experiments can report on biomolecule structural changes and motions. Hidden Markov models (HMM) facilitate extraction of the sequence of hidden states from noisy data through construction of probabilistic models. Typically, the true number of states is determined by the Bayesian information criteria (BIC); however, constraints resulting from short data sets and Poisson-distributed photons in radiative processes like fluorescence can limit successful application of goodness-of-fit statistics. For single molecule intensity trajectories, additional information criteria such as peak localization error (LE) and chi-square probabilities can incorporate theoretical constraints on experimental data while modifying normal HMM. Chi-square minimization also serves as a stopping point of the iteration in which the system parameters are trained. Peak LE enables exclusion of overfitted and overlapped states. These constraints and criteria are tested against BIC on simulated single molecule trajectories to best identify the true number of emissive levels in any sequence.},

@article{Gonzalez2013,
abstract = {A novel hierarchy of coarse-grain, sequence-dependent, rigid-base models of B-form DNA in solution is introduced. The hierarchy depends on both the assumed range of energetic couplings, and the extent of sequence dependence of the model parameters. A significant feature of the models is that they exhibit the phenomenon of frustration: each base cannot simultaneously minimize the energy of all of its interactions. As a consequence, an arbitrary DNA oligomer has an intrinsic or pre-existing stress, with the level of this frustration dependent on the particular sequence of the oligomer. Attention is focussed on the particular model in the hierarchy that has nearest-neighbor interactions and dimer sequence dependence of the model parameters. For a Gaussian version of this model, a complete coarse-grain parameter set is estimated. The parameterized model allows, for an oligomer of arbitrary length and sequence, a simple and explicit construction of an approximation to the configuration-space equilibrium probability density function for the oligomer in solution. The training set leading to the coarse-grain parameter set is itself extracted from a recent and extensive database of a large number of independent, atomic-resolution molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of short DNA oligomers immersed in explicit solvent. The Kullback-Leibler divergence between probability density functions is used to make several quantitative assessments of our nearest-neighbor, dimer-dependent model, which is compared against others in the hierarchy to assess various assumptions pertaining both to the locality of the energetic couplings and to the level of sequence dependence of its parameters. It is also compared directly against all-atom MD simulation to assess its predictive capabilities. The results show that the nearest-neighbor, dimer-dependent model can successfully resolve sequence effects both within and between oligomers. For example, due to the presence of frustration, the model can successfully predict the nonlocal changes in the minimum energy configuration of an oligomer that are consequent upon a local change of sequence at the level of a single point mutation.},

abstract = {We introduce a new analysis technique for fluorescence fluctuation data. Time-integrated fluorescence cumulant analysis (TIFCA) extracts information from the cumulants of the integrated fluorescence intensity. TIFCA builds on our earlier FCA theory, but in contrast to FCA or photon counting histogram (PCH) analysis is valid for arbitrary sampling times. The motivation for long sampling times lies in the improvement of the signal/noise ratio of the data. Because FCA and PCH theory are not valid in this regime, we first derive a theoretical model of cumulant functions for arbitrary sampling times. TIFCA is the first exact theory that describes the effects of sampling time on fluorescence fluctuation experiments. We calculate factorial cumulants of the photon counts for various sampling times by rebinning of the original data. Fits of the data to models determine the brightness, the occupation number, and the diffusion time of each species. To provide the tools for a rigorous error analysis of TIFCA, expressions for the variance of cumulants are developed and tested. We demonstrate that over a limited range rebinning reduces the relative error of higher order cumulants, and therefore improves the signal/noise ratio. The first four cumulant functions are explicitly calculated and are applied to simple dye systems to test the validity of TIFCA and demonstrate its ability to resolve species.},

abstract = {Green fluorescence protein (GFP)-based fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) is increasingly used in investigation of inter- and intramolecular interactions in living cells. In this report, we present a modified method for FRET quantification in cultured cells using conventional fluorescence microscopy. To reliably measure FRET, three positive control constructs in which a cyan fluorescence protein and a yellow fluorescence protein were linked by peptides of 15, 24, or 37 amino acid residues were prepared. FRET was detected using a spectrofluorometer, a laser scanning confocal microscope, and an inverted fluorescence microscope. Three calculation methods for FRET quantification using fluorescence microscopes were compared. By normalization against expression levels of GFP fusion proteins, the modified method gave consistent FRET values that could be compared among different cells with varying protein expression levels. Whole-cell global analysis using this method allowed FRET measurement with high spatial resolutions. Using such a procedure, the interaction of synaptic proteins syntaxin and the synaptosomal associated protein of 25 kDa (SNAP-25) was examined in PC12 cells, which showed strong FRET on plasma membranes. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of the modified method for FRET measurement in live cell systems.},

abstract = {Circular dichroism (CD) is remarkably sensitive to the conformational states of nucleic acids; therefore, CD spectroscopy has been used to study most features of DNA and RNA structures. Quadruplexes are among the significant noncanonical nucleic acids architectures that have received special attentions recently. This article presents examples on the contribution of CD spectroscopy to our knowledge of quadruplex structures and their polymorphism. The examples were selected to demonstrate the potential of this simple method in the quadruplex field. As CD spectroscopy detects only the global feature of a macromolecule, it should preferably be used in combination with other techniques. On the other hand, CD spectroscopy, often as a pioneering approach, can reveal the formation of particular structural arrangements, to search for the conditions stabilizing the structures, to follow the transitions between various structural states, to explore kinetics of their appearance, to determine thermodynamic parameters and also detect formation of higher order structures. This article aims to show that CD spectroscopy is an important complementary technique to NMR spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction in quadruplex studies.},

abstract = {The persistence length is calculated for polyelectrolyte chains with fixed bond lengths and bond angles (pi-theta), and a potential energy consisting of the screened Coulomb interaction between beads, potential wells alpha phi(i)2 for the dihedral angles phi(i), and coupling terms beta phi(i) phi(i+/-1). This model defines a librating chain that reduces in appropriate limits to the freely rotating or wormlike chains, it can accommodate local crumpling or extreme stiffness, and it is easy to simulate. A planar-quadratic (pq), analytic approximation is based on an expansion of the electrostatic energy in eigenfunctions of the quadratic form that describes the backbone energy, and on the assumption that the quadratic form not only is positive but also adequately confines the chain in an infinite phase space of dihedral angles to the physically unique part with all |phi(i)| < pi. The pq approximation is available under these weak constraints, but the simulations confirm its quantitative accuracy only under the expected condition that alpha is large, that is, for very stiff chains. Stiff chains can also be simulated with small alpha and small theta and compared to an OSF approximation suitably generalized to chains with finite rather than vanishing theta, and increasing agreement with OSF is found the smaller is theta. The two approximations, one becoming exact as alpha --> infinity with fixed theta, the other as theta --> 0 with fixed alpha, are quantitatively similar in behavior, both giving a persistence length P = P0 + aD2 for stiff chains, where D is the Debye length. However, the coefficient apq is about twice the value of aOSF. Under other conditions the simulations show that P may or not be linear in D2 at small or moderate D, depending on the magnitudes of alpha, beta, theta, and the charge density but always becomes linear at large D. Even at a moderately low charge density, corresponding to fewer than 20\% of the beads being charged, and with strong crumpling induced by large beta, increasing D dissolves blobs and recovers a linear dependence of P on D2, although a lower power of D gives an adequate fit at moderate D. For the class of models considered, it is concluded that the only universal feature is the asymptotic linearity of P in D2, regardless of flexibility or stiffness.},

A modified maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) was developed to compensate for localized background fluorescence and instrument response. With this algorithm, we were able to robustly extract fluorescent lifetimes from their respective decays with as few as 20 photons. Fluorescent lifetimes extracted using an MLE were found to be highly dependent on background fluorescence. We show that appropriate factors are required to extract true lifetime trajectories from single fluorophores.},

abstract = {We use Langevin dynamics to investigate the role played by the recently discovered force-induced entropic energy barrier on the two-state hopping phenomena that has been observed in single RNA, DNA and protein molecules placed under a stretching force. Simple considerations about the free energy of a molecule readily show that the application of force introduces an entropic barrier separating the collapsed state of the molecule, from a force-driven extended conformation. A notable characteristic of the force induced barrier is its long distances to transition state, up to tens of nanometers, which renders the kinetics of crossing this barrier highly sensitive to an applied force. Langevin dynamics across such force induced barriers readily demonstrates the hopping behavior observed for a variety of single molecules placed under force. Such hopping is frequently interpreted as a manifestation of two-state folding/unfolding reactions observed in bulk experiments. However, given that such barriers do not exist at zero force these reactions do not take place at all in bulk.},

@article{seidel2010,
abstract = {Two complementary methods in confocal single-molecule fluorescence spectroscopy are presented to analyze conformational dynamics by Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET) measurements considering simulated and experimental data. First, an extension of photon distribution analysis (PDA) is applied to characterize conformational exchange between two or more states via global analysis of the shape of FRET peaks for different time bins. PDA accurately predicts the shape of FRET efficiency histograms in the presence of FRET fluctuations, taking into account shot noise and background contributions. Dynamic-PDA quantitatively recovers FRET efficiencies of the interconverting states and relaxation times of dynamics on the time scale of the diffusion time t(d) (typically milliseconds), with a dynamic range of the method of about +/-1 order of magnitude with respect to t(d). Correction procedures are proposed to consider the factors limiting the accuracy of dynamic-PDA, such as brightness variations, shortening of the observation time due to diffusion, and a contribution of multimolecular events. Second, an analysis procedure for multiparameter fluorescence detection is presented, where intensity-derived FRET efficiency is correlated with the fluorescence lifetime of the donor quenched by FRET. If a maximum likelihood estimator is applied to compute a mean fluorescence lifetime of mixed states, one obtains a fluorescence weighted mean lifetime. Thus a mixed state is detected by a characteristic shift of the fluorescence lifetime, which becomes longer than that expected for a single species with the same intensity-derived FRET efficiency. Analysis tools for direct visual inspection of two-dimensional diagrams of FRET efficiency versus donor lifetime are presented for the cases of static and dynamic FRET. Finally these new techniques are compared with fluorescence correlation spectroscopy.},

abstract = {We used a force-measuring laser tweezers apparatus to determine the elastic properties of lambda-bacteriophage DNA as a function of ionic strength and in the presence of multivalent cations. The electrostatic contribution to the persistence length P varied as the inverse of the ionic strength in monovalent salt, as predicted by the standard worm-like polyelectrolyte model. However, ionic strength is not always the dominant variable in determining the elastic properties of DNA. Monovalent and multivalent ions have quite different effects even when present at the same ionic strength. Multivalent ions lead to P values as low as 250-300 A, well below the high-salt "fully neutralized" value of 450-500 A characteristic of DNA in monovalent salt. The ions Mg2+ and Co(NH3)63+, in which the charge is centrally concentrated, yield lower P values than the polyamines putrescine2+ and spermidine3+, in which the charge is linearly distributed. The elastic stretch modulus, S, and P display opposite trends with ionic strength, in contradiction to predictions of macroscopic elasticity theory. DNA is well described as a worm-like chain at concentrations of trivalent cations capable of inducing condensation, if condensation is prevented by keeping the molecule stretched. A retractile force appears in the presence of multivalent cations at molecular extensions that allow intramolecular contacts, suggesting condensation in stretched DNA occurs by a "thermal ratchet" mechanism.},

abstract = {Two factors are mainly responsible for the stability of the DNA double helix: base pairing between complementary strands and stacking between adjacent bases. By studying DNA molecules with solitary nicks and gaps we measure temperature and salt dependence of the stacking free energy of the DNA double helix. For the first time, DNA stacking parameters are obtained directly (without extrapolation) for temperatures from below room temperature to close to melting temperature. We also obtain DNA stacking parameters for different salt concentrations ranging from 15 to 100 mM Na+. From stacking parameters of individual contacts, we calculate base-stacking contribution to the stability of A*T- and G*C-containing DNA polymers. We find that temperature and salt dependences of the stacking term fully determine the temperature and the salt dependence of DNA stability parameters. For all temperatures and salt concentrations employed in present study, base-stacking is the main stabilizing factor in the DNA double helix. A*T pairing is always destabilizing and G*C pairing contributes almost no stabilization. Base-stacking interaction dominates not only in the duplex overall stability but also significantly contributes into the dependence of the duplex stability on its sequence.},

abstract = {In single-molecule FRET experiments with pulsed lasers, not only the colors of the photons but also the fluorescence lifetimes can be monitored. Although these quantities appear to be random, they are modulated by conformational dynamics. In order to extract information about such dynamics, we develop the theory of the joint distribution of FRET efficiencies and fluorescence lifetimes determined from bins (or bursts) of photons. Our starting point is a rigorous formal expression for the distribution of the numbers of donor and acceptor photons and donor lifetimes in a bin that treats the influence of conformational dynamics on all timescales. This formula leads to an analytic result for a two-state system interconverting on a timescale slower than the interphoton time and to an efficient simulation algorithm for multistate dynamics. The shape of the joint distribution contains more information about conformational dynamics than the FRET efficiency histogram alone. In favorable cases, the connectivity of the underlying conformational states can be determined directly by simple inspection of the projection of the joint distribution on the efficiency-lifetime plane.},

abstract = {The current advances of fluorescence microscopy and new fluorescent probes make fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) a powerful technique for studying protein-protein interactions inside living cells. It is very hard to quantitatively analyze FRET efficiency using intensity-based FRET imaging microscopy due to the presence of autofluorescence and spectral crosstalks. In this study, we for the first time developed a novel photobleaching-based method to quantitatively detect FRET efficiency (Pb-FRET) by selectively photobleaching acceptor. The Pb-FRET method requires two fluorescence detection channels: a donor channel (CH 1 to selectively detect the fluorescence from donor, and a FRET channel (CH 2 which normally includes the fluorescence from both acceptor and donor due to emission spectral crosstalk. We used the Pb-FRET method to quantitatively measure the FRET efficiency of SCAT3, a caspase-3 indicator based on FRET, inside single living cells stably expressing SCAT3 during STS-induced apoptosis. At 0, 6 and 12 h after STS treatment, the FRET efficiency of SCAT3 obtained by Pb-FRET inside living cells was verified by two-photon excitation (TPE) fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM). The temporal resolution of Pb-FRET method is in second time-scale for ROI photobleaching, even in microsecond time-scale for spot photobleaching. Our results demonstrate that the Pb-FRET method is independent of photobleaching degree, and is very useful for quantitatively monitoring protein-protein interactions inside single living cell.},

abstract = {In many apoptosis pathways, activation of caspase-3 is considered the final stage. In this study, we studied PDT induced caspase-3 activation with fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) technique. A recombinant caspase-3 substrate, SCAT3, was used as the FRET probe. FRET fluorescence images were collected after PDT or TNF-alpha induced apoptosis. By analyzing the dynamic changes of FRET fluorescence, the results indicate that the caspase-3 activation started immediately after the PDT treatment. In contrast, FRET disruption caused by caspase-3 activation started at 3h after TNF-alpha treatment, due to different signaling pathway. The results have proofed, for the first time, that FRET is a sensitive technique that can be used to investigate PDT-induced activation of caspase-3 in real-time and in single cells. By choosing appropriate recombinant substrates as FRET probes, it is likely that FRET technique will provide a new real-time means to study the mechanism of PDT at single cell level.},

abstract = {The intrinsic rigidities of DNA and RNA helices are generally thought to arise from some combination of vertical base-stacking interactions and intra-helix phosphate-phosphate charge repulsion; however, the relative contributions of these two types of interaction to helix rigidity have not been quantified. To address this issue, we have measured the rotational decay times of a 'gapped-duplex' DNA molecule possessing a central, single-stranded region, dT24, before and after addition of the free purine base, N6-methyladenine ((me)A). Upon addition of (me)A, the bases pair with the T residues, forming a continuous stack within the gap region. Formation of the gapped duplex is accompanied by a nearly 2-fold increase in decay time, to values that are indistinguishable from the full duplex control for monovalent salt concentrations up to 90 mM. These results indicate that at least 90\% of the rigidity of the dT(n)-dA(n) homopolymer derives from base pair stacking effects, with phosphate-phosphate interactions contributing relatively little to net helix rigidity at moderate salt concentrations.},

@article{Naimushin2000,
abstract = {DNA may exhibit three different kinds of bends: 1) permanent bends; 2) slowly relaxing bends due to fluctuations in a prevailing equilibrium between differently curved secondary conformations; and 3) rapidly relaxing dynamic bends within a single potential-of-mean-force basin. The dynamic bending rigidity (kappa(d)), or equivalently the dynamic persistence length, P(d) = kappa(d)/k(B)T, governs the rapidly relaxing bends, which are responsible for the flexural dynamics of DNA on a short time scale, t < or = 10(-5) s. However, all three kinds of bends contribute to the total equilibrium persistence length, P(tot), according to 1/P(tot) congruent with 1/P(pb) + 1/P(sr) + 1/P(d), where P(pb) is the contribution of the permanent bends and P(sr) is the contribution of the slowly relaxing bends. Both P(d) and P(tot) are determined for the same 200-bp DNA in 4 mM ionic strength by measuring its optical anisotropy, r(t), from 0 to 10 micros. Time-resolved fluorescence polarization anisotropy (FPA) measurements yield r(t) for DNA/ethidium complexes (1 dye/200 bp) from 0 to 120 ns. A new transient polarization grating (TPG) experiment provides r(t) for DNA/methylene blue complexes (1 dye/100 bp) over a much longer time span, from 20 ns to 10 micros. Accurate data in the very tail of the decay enable a model-independent determination of the relaxation time (tau(R)) of the end-over-end tumbling motion, from which P(tot) = 500 A is estimated. The FPA data are used to obtain the best-fit pairs of P(d) and torsion elastic constant (alpha) values that fit those data equally well, and which are used to eliminate alpha as an independent variable. When the relevant theory is fitted to the entire TPG signal (S(t)), the end-over-end rotational diffusion coefficient is fixed at its measured value and alpha is eliminated in favor of P(d). Neither a true minimum in chi-squared nor a satisfactory fit could be obtained for P(d) anywhere in the range 500-5000 A, unless an adjustable amplitude of azimuthal wobble of the methylene blue was admitted. In that case, a well-defined global minimum and a reasonably good fit emerged at P(d) = 2000 A and <deltazeta(2)>(1/2) = 25 degrees. The discrimination against P(d) values <1600 A is very great. By combining the values, P(tot) = 500 A and P(d) = 2000 A with a literature estimate, P(pb) = 1370 A, a value P(sr) = 1300 A is estimated for the contribution of slowly relaxing bends. This value is analyzed in terms of a simple model in which the DNA is divided up into domains containing m bp, each of which experiences an all-or-none equilibrium between a straight and a uniformly curved conformation. With an appropriate estimate of the average bend angle per basepair of the curved conformation, a lower bound estimate, m = 55 bp, is obtained for the domain size of the coherently bent state. Previous measurements suggest that this coherent bend is not directional, or phase-locked, to the azimuthal orientation of the filament.},

abstract = {F\"{o}rster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) experiments probe molecular distances via distance dependent energy transfer from an excited donor dye to an acceptor dye. Single molecule experiments not only probe average distances, but also distance distributions or even fluctuations, and thus provide a powerful tool to study biomolecular structure and dynamics. However, the measured energy transfer efficiency depends not only on the distance between the dyes, but also on their mutual orientation, which is typically inaccessible to experiments. Thus, assumptions on the orientation distributions and averages are usually made, limiting the accuracy of the distance distributions extracted from FRET experiments. Here, we demonstrate that by combining single molecule FRET experiments with the mutual dye orientation statistics obtained from Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations, improved estimates of distances and distributions are obtained. From the simulated time-dependent mutual orientations, FRET efficiencies are calculated and the full statistics of individual photon absorption, energy transfer, and photon emission events is obtained from subsequent Monte Carlo (MC) simulations of the FRET kinetics. All recorded emission events are collected to bursts from which efficiency distributions are calculated in close resemblance to the actual FRET experiment, taking shot noise fully into account. Using polyproline chains with attached Alexa 488 and Alexa 594 dyes as a test system, we demonstrate the feasibility of this approach by direct comparison to experimental data. We identified cis-isomers and different static local environments as sources of the experimentally observed heterogeneity. Reconstructions of distance distributions from experimental data at different levels of theory demonstrate how the respective underlying assumptions and approximations affect the obtained accuracy. Our results show that dye fluctuations obtained from MD simulations, combined with MC single photon kinetics, provide a versatile tool to improve the accuracy of distance distributions that can be extracted from measured single molecule FRET efficiencies.},

abstract = {DNA geometry depends on relative humidity. Using the CHARMM22 force field to push B-DNA to A-DNA, a molecular dynamics simulation of a mixed-sequence 24-basepair DNA double-stranded oligomer, starting from B-DNA, was carried out to explore both the mechanism of the transition and the evolution of hydration patterns on the surface of DNA. Over the 11-ns trajectory, the transition recapitulates the slide-first, roll-later mechanism, is opposed by DNA electrostatics, and is favored by an increasing amount of condensed sodium ions. Hydration was characterized by counting the hydrogen bonds between water and DNA, and by the number of water bridges linking two DNA atoms. The number of hydrogen bonds between water and DNA remains constant during the transition, but there is a 40\% increase in the number of water bridges, in agreement with the principle of economy of hydration. Water bridges emerge as delicate sensors of both structure and dynamics of DNA. Both local flexibility and the frustration of the water network on the surface of DNA probably account for the low populations and short residence times of the bridges, and for the lubricant role of water in ligand-DNA interactions.},

abstract = {A novel potassium sensing oligonucleotide (PSO) was constructed by attaching fluorophores 6-FAM and 6-TAMRA to the 5'- and 3'-termini of d(GGG TTA GGG TTA GGG TTA GGG), respectively. The affinity of PSO for K+ was 43 000 times greater than that for Na+, high enough selectivity enabling quantitation of K+ specifically in the presence of excess Na+. Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) to 6-TAMRA from 6-FAM of PSO was observed only in the presence of K+. This phenomenon is based on the approximation of the two fluorophores upon formation of a guanine quartet mediated by K+. Furthermore, the fluorescent color of PSO changes from yellow to red upon formation of the complex, thereby enabling visualization of K+ in aqueous media.},

abstract = {We present a theoretical study on the impact of an interface on the FRET efficiency of a surface-bound acceptor-donor system. The FRET efficiency can be modified by two effects. Firstly, the donor's electromagnetic field at the acceptor's position is changed due to the partial reflection of the donor's field. Secondly, both the donor's and the acceptor's quantum yield of fluorescence can be changed due to the interface-induced enhancement of the radiative emission rate (Purcell effect). Numerical results for a FRET-pair at a glass-water interface are given.},

@article{Müller04,
abstract = {A novel technique for the analysis of fluorescence fluctuation experiments is introduced. Fluorescence cumulant analysis (FCA) exploits the factorial cumulants of the photon counts and resolves heterogeneous samples based on differences in brightness. A simple analytical model connects the cumulants of the photon counts with the brightness epsilon and the number of molecules N in the optical observation volume for each fluorescent species. To provide the tools for a rigorous error analysis of FCA, expressions for the variance of factorial cumulants are developed and tested. We compare theory with experiment by analyzing dye mixtures and simple fluorophore solutions with FCA. A comparison of FCA with photon-counting histogram (PCH) analysis, a related technique, shows that both methods give identical results within experimental uncertainty. Both FCA and PCH are restricted to data sampling times that are short compared to the diffusion time of molecules through the observation volume of the instrument. But FCA theory, in contrast to PCH, can be extended to treat arbitrary sampling times. Here, we derive analytical expressions for the second factorial cumulant as a function of the sampling time and demonstrate that the theory successfully models fluorescence fluctuation data.},

@article{Lee2014,
abstract = {DNA constructs labeled with cyanine fluorescent dyes are important substrates for single-molecule (sm) studies of the functional activity of protein-DNA complexes. We previously studied the local DNA backbone fluctuations of replication fork and primer-template DNA constructs labeled with Cy3/Cy5 donor-acceptor F\"{o}rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) chromophore pairs and showed that, contrary to dyes linked 'externally' to the bases with flexible tethers, direct 'internal' (and rigid) insertion of the chromophores into the sugar-phosphate backbones resulted in DNA constructs that could be used to study intrinsic and protein-induced DNA backbone fluctuations by both smFRET and sm Fluorescent Linear Dichroism (smFLD). Here we show that these rigidly inserted Cy3/Cy5 chromophores also exhibit two additional useful properties, showing both high photo-stability and minimal effects on the local thermodynamic stability of the DNA constructs. The increased photo-stability of the internal labels significantly reduces the proportion of false positive smFRET conversion 'background' signals, thereby simplifying interpretations of both smFRET and smFLD experiments, while the decreased effects of the internal probes on local thermodynamic stability also make fluctuations sensed by these probes more representative of the unperturbed DNA structure. We suggest that internal probe labeling may be useful in studies of many DNA-protein interaction systems.},

We provide a standardized approach for analyzing these data in the freely available software package SMART: Single Molecule Analysis Research Tool. SMART provides a format for organizing and easily accessing single molecule data, a general hidden Markov modeling algorithm for fitting an array of possible models specified by the user, a standardized data structure and graphical user interfaces to streamline the analysis and visualization of data. This approach guides experimental design, facilitating acquisition of the maximal information from single molecule experiments. SMART also provides a standardized format to allow dissemination of single molecule data and transparency in the analysis of reported data.},

abstract = {The role of centrally located and distributed base pair mismatches ('melting bubbles') on localized bending and stiffness of short dsDNA fragments is evaluated using time-dependent fluorescence lifetime measurements. Distributed melting bubbles are found to induce larger bending angles and decreased levels of stiffness in DNA than centrally located ones of comparable overall size. Our results indicate that spontaneous local opening-up of the DNA duplex could facilitate sharp bending of short DNA strands even in the absence of DNA binding proteins. We also find that the occurrence of two closely spaced melting bubbles will generally be favored when a large energetic barrier must be overcome in forming the desired bent DNA structure.},

abstract = {Determining the rate of forming the truly folded conformation of ultrafast folding proteins is an important issue for both experiments and simulations. The double-norleucine mutant of the 35-residue villin subdomain is the focus of recent computer simulations with atomistic molecular dynamics because it is currently the fastest folding protein. The folding kinetics of this protein have been measured in laser temperature-jump experiments using tryptophan fluorescence as a probe of overall folding. The conclusion from the simulations, however, is that the rate determined by fluorescence is significantly larger than the rate of overall folding. We have therefore employed an independent experimental method to determine the folding rate. The decay of the tryptophan triplet-state in photoselection experiments was used to monitor the change in the unfolded population for a sequence of the villin subdomain with one amino acid difference from that of the laser temperature-jump experiments, but with almost identical equilibrium properties. Folding times obtained in a two-state analysis of the results from the two methods at denaturant concentrations varying from 1.5-6.0 M guanidinium chloride are in excellent agreement, with an average difference of only 20\%. Polynomial extrapolation of all the data to zero denaturant yields a folding time of 220 (+100,-70) ns at 283 K, suggesting that under these conditions the barrier between folded and unfolded states has effectively disappeared--the so-called "downhill scenario."},

abstract = {We depict two algorithms to calculate correlation functions from two different time resolved single molecule fluorescence experiments without the need of time binning. Our first procedure allows to calculate the reduced linear dichroism from polarization resolved fluorescence data. Since we process single photon counts instead of time binned data, considerably faster fluctuations of the dichroism can be analyzed than with conventional methods. With our second procedure time resolved fluorescence obtained with a time correlated single photon counting setup can be analyzed with respect to fluorescence lifetime fluctuations. Again this new algorithm processes single photon events making time binning of photon counts obsolete. Both methods presented are characterized by enhanced time resolution thus allowing to study fast fluctuations of either single molecular orientation or fluorescence life times, respectively.},

abstract = {Single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) is an essential intermediate in various DNA metabolic processes and interacts with a large number of proteins. Due to its flexibility, the conformations of ssDNA in solution can only be described using statistical approaches, such as flexibly jointed or worm-like chain models. However, there is limited data available to assess such models quantitatively, especially for describing the flexibility of short ssDNA and RNA. To address this issue, we performed FRET studies of a series of oligodeoxythymidylates, (dT)N, over a wide range of salt concentrations and chain lengths (10 < or = N < or = 70 nucleotides), which provide systematic constraints for testing theoretical models. Unlike in mechanical studies where available ssDNA conformations are averaged out during the time it takes to perform measurements, fluorescence lifetimes may act here as an internal clock that influences fluorescence signals depending on how fast the ssDNA conformations fluctuate. A reasonably good agreement could be obtained between our data and the worm-like chain model provided that limited relaxations of the ssDNA conformations occur within the fluorescence lifetime of the donor. The persistence length thus estimated ranges from 1.5 nm in 2 M NaCl to 3 nm in 25 mM NaCl.},

abstract = {Single-molecule fluorescence spectroscopy and correlation methods are finding increasing applications in the investigation of biomolecular dynamics, especially together with F\"{o}rster resonance energy transfer (FRET). Here, we use the combination of start-stop experiments and classical fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) to obtain complete intensity auto- and cross-correlation functions from picoseconds to seconds for investigating the dynamics of unfolded proteins and peptides. In combination with distance information from single-molecule transfer efficiency histograms, we can analyze the data in terms of a diffusive process on a potential of mean force to obtain intramolecular diffusion coefficients. This allows us to extend our previous analysis of the time scales of chain dynamics into the low nanosecond range for peptides and into the microsecond range for a small cold shock protein (Csp). Dynamics in short unstructured peptides can be detected down to a time scale of about 10 ns, placing a lower limit on the time scales accessible with correlation methods and currently used dye pairs. We find no evidence for microsecond fluctuations in unfolded Csp, suggesting that its global chain dynamics occur predominantly in the tens of nanosecond range. We further investigate the position dependence of these dynamics by placing donor and acceptor dyes at different positions within the chain and find a decrease in the intramolecular diffusion coefficient by a factor of 3 upon moving one of the dyes toward the center of the polypeptide. Obtaining dynamic information on a wide range of time scales from single-molecule photon statistics will be of increasing importance for the study of unfolded proteins and for biomolecules in general.},

A commonly used approach is to further average the noisy time trace by binning, followed by placing a threshold to discriminate signal from background. The choice of smoothing parameters and the placement of the threshold may impact on the efficiency with which the information-rich region can be harvested, among other potential complications. Here we introduce a procedure that operates on the data sequence photon by photon, thereby relieving the incertitude in choosing binning-thresholding parameters. We characterize this procedure by detecting the two-photon emission bursts from diffusing single gold nanoparticles. The results support our burst-finding procedure as a reliable and efficient way of detecting and harvesting photon bursts from diffusing experiments.},

Intermolecular fluorescence resonance energy transfer measurements provide information about the dynamic interactions of staphylococcal nuclease with single substrate molecules. The experimental methods demonstrated here should prove generally useful in studies of protein folding and enzyme catalysis at single-molecule resolution.},

abstract = {Triplet blinking is a phenomenon observed commonly in single molecule fluorescence spectroscopy. At high to moderate excitation intensities one can distinguish bright (on) and dark (off) periods in the fluorescence intensity trajectory caused by sojourns into the nonemissive triplet state. In this work, we focus on triplet blinking of an immobilized molecule in the low excitation regime, where a threshold between on and off intensity levels cannot be set, and, therefore, a standard on/off analysis of fluorescence intensity trajectories is not possible. In the low excitation regime triplet blinking parameters can be recovered from photon arrival time trajectories, i.e., records of individual photon arrival time. We use computer-generated data to compare the recovery of the triplet blinking parameters from the intensity correlation function (ICF) and the histogram of interarrival time. We have found that the ICF offers a better statistics for the recovery of the triplet blinking parameters.},

@article{McKinney06,
abstract = {The analysis of single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) trajectories has become one of significant biophysical interest. In deducing the transition rates between various states of a system for time-binned data, researchers have relied on simple, but often arbitrary methods of extracting rates from FRET trajectories. Although these methods have proven satisfactory in cases of well-separated, low-noise, two- or three-state systems, they become less reliable when applied to a system of greater complexity. We have developed an analysis scheme that casts single-molecule time-binned FRET trajectories as hidden Markov processes, allowing one to determine, based on probability alone, the most likely FRET-value distributions of states and their interconversion rates while simultaneously determining the most likely time sequence of underlying states for each trajectory. Together with a transition density plot and Bayesian information criterion we can also determine the number of different states present in a system in addition to the state-to-state transition probabilities. Here we present the algorithm and test its limitations with various simulated data and previously reported Holliday junction data. The algorithm is then applied to the analysis of the binding and dissociation of three RecA monomers on a DNA construct.},

Statistical tests of the photon-counting data suggested that the simple "on/off" discrete state model is inconsistent with experimental results. Instead, a continuous emission state distribution model was found to be more appropriate. Autocorrelation analysis of lifetime and intensity fluctuations showed a nonlinear correlation between them. These results were consistent with the model that charged quantum dots were also emissive, and that time-dependent charge migration gave rise to the observed photoluminescence dynamics.},

abstract = {We describe a novel method to measure rotational diffusion of large biomolecules in solution based on fluorescence correlation on the nanosecond time scale. In contrast to conventional fluorescence anisotropy measurements, a correlation-based method will also work if the rotational diffusion time is much longer than the fluorescence decay time. Thus, the method is suited to study the rotational diffusion of macromolecules having rotational diffusion times of dozens to hundreds of nanoseconds, which is considerably larger than the fluorescence lifetime of most commercially available dyes or auto-fluorescent proteins. A pulsed interleaved excitation scheme with crossed excitation polarization maximizes the time-dependent amplitude of the measured correlation curve as caused by rotational diffusion. Using the determined rotational diffusion coefficient, precise values of the hydrodynamic radius can be obtained. The method is exemplified on sizing a set of common globular proteins.},

abstract = {A new measure is presented to quantify the local topographical feature, i.e., diversity in transitions from a state to the others, on complex networks. This measure is composed of two contributions: one is related to the number of outgoing links from a state (known as degree) and the other is related to heterogeneity in transition probabilities from a state to the others associated with the links. To illustrate the potential of the new measure, we apply it to the multiscale state space networks (SSNs) extracted directly from the single-molecule time series of protein fluctuation of the NADH:flavin oxidoreductase complex by using a recently developed technique [Li, C. B.; Yang, H.; Komatsuzaki, T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008, 105, 536]. We find that the multiscale SSN network structures dependent on the time scale of observation are not differentiated significantly in the topological feature of the SSNs where the connectivity pattern among the nodes is solely taken into account, but instead in the weighted properties of the network including the heterogeneous strengths of transitions and the resident probabilities of the nodes. The relationship of the transition heterogeneity with the anomalous diffusion observed in the single-molecule measurement is also discussed.},

abstract = {In single-molecule FRET experiments with pulsed lasers, not only the colors of the photons but also the fluorescence lifetimes can be monitored. Although these quantities appear to be random, they are modulated by conformational dynamics. In order to extract information about such dynamics, we develop the theory of the joint distribution of FRET efficiencies and fluorescence lifetimes determined from bins (or bursts) of photons. Our starting point is a rigorous formal expression for the distribution of the numbers of donor and acceptor photons and donor lifetimes in a bin that treats the influence of conformational dynamics on all timescales. This formula leads to an analytic result for a two-state system interconverting on a timescale slower than the interphoton time and to an efficient simulation algorithm for multistate dynamics. The shape of the joint distribution contains more information about conformational dynamics than the FRET efficiency histogram alone. In favorable cases, the connectivity of the underlying conformational states can be determined directly by simple inspection of the projection of the joint distribution on the efficiency-lifetime plane.},

We extend the many-particle simulation algorithm to the Michaelis-Menten case by utilizing the Green function previously derived for excited-state reversible geminate recombination with different lifetimes (Gopich, I. V.; Agmon, N. J. Chem. Phys. 2000, 110, 10433). Running the simulation for representative parameter sets in the time domain and under steady-state conditions, we find poor agreement with classical kinetics but excellent agreement with some of the modern theories for bimolecular diffusion-influenced reactions. Our simulation algorithm can be readily extended to the biologically interesting case of dense patches of membrane-bound enzymes.},

abstract = {DNA stably exists as a double-stranded structure due to hydrogen-bonding and stacking interactions between bases. The stacking interactions are strengthened when DNA is paired, which results in great enhancement of bending rigidity. We study the effects of this stacking-induced stiffness difference on DNA denaturation and bubble formations. To this end, we model double-stranded DNA as a duplex of two semiflexible chains whose persistence length varies depending on the base-pair distance. Using this model, we perform the Langevin dynamics simulation to examine the characteristics of the denaturation transition and the statistics of the bubbles. We find that the inclusion of the stacking interactions causes the denaturation transition to be much sharper than otherwise. At physiological temperature, the stacking interactions prohibit the initiation of bubble formation but promote bubbles, once grown, to retain the large size.},

abstract = {Using cryo-electron microscopy we reconstructed the three-dimensional trajectories adopted in cryovitrified solutions by double-stranded DNA molecules in which the backbone of one strand lacked a phosphate at regular intervals of 20 nucleotides. The shape of such nicked DNA molecules was compared with that of DNA molecules with exactly the same sequence but without any single-stranded scissions. Upon changing the salt concentration we observed opposite effects of charge neutralization on nicked and non-nicked DNA. In low salt solutions (10 mM Tris-HCl, 10 mM NaCl) the applied dense nicking caused ca 3.5-fold reduction of the DNA persistence length as compared with non-nicked DNA. Upon increasing the salt concentration (to 150 mM NaCl and 10 mM MgCl2) the persistence length of non-nicked DNA appreciably decreased while that of nicked DNA molecules increased by a factor of 2.},

@article{Okamoto2012,
abstract = {Single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (smFRET) measurement is a powerful technique for investigating dynamics of biomolecules, for which various efforts have been made to overcome significant stochastic noise. Time stamp (TS) measurement has been employed experimentally to enrich information within the signals, while data analyses such as the hidden Markov model (HMM) have been successfully applied to recover the trajectories of molecular state transitions from time-binned photon counting signals or images. In this article, we introduce the HMM for TS-FRET signals, employing the variational Bayes (VB) inference to solve the model, and demonstrate the application of VB-HMM-TS-FRET to simulated TS-FRET data. The same analysis using VB-HMM is conducted for other models and the previously reported change point detection scheme. The performance is compared to other analysis methods or data types and we show that our VB-HMM-TS-FRET analysis can achieve the best performance and results in the highest time resolution. Finally, an smFRET experiment was conducted to observe spontaneous branch migration of Holliday-junction DNA. VB-HMM-TS-FRET was successfully applied to reconstruct the state transition trajectory with the number of states consistent with the nucleotide sequence. The results suggest that a single migration process frequently involves rearrangement of multiple basepairs.},

abstract = {There has been much confusion recently about the relative merits of different approaches, osmotic stress, preferential interaction, and crowding, to describe the indirect effect of solutes on macromolecular conformations and reactions. To strengthen all interpretations of measurements and to forestall further unnecessary conceptual or linguistic confusion, we show here how the different perspectives all can be reconciled. Our approach is through the Gibbs-Duhem relation, the universal constraint on the number of ways it is possible to change the temperature, pressure, and chemical potentials of the several components in any thermodynamically defined system. From this general Gibbs-Duhem equation, it is possible to see the equivalence of the different perspectives and even to show the precise identity of the more specialized equations that the different approaches use.},

Global reconfiguration of the chain occurs on a time scale of approximately equal to 50 ns and slows down concomitant with chain collapse under folding conditions. These diffusive dynamics provide a missing link between the phenomenological chemical kinetics commonly used in protein folding and a physical description in terms of quantitative free energy surfaces. The experiments demonstrate the potential of single-molecule methods in accessing the biologically important nanosecond time scales even in heterogeneous populations.},

We now have a basic roadmap of the types of polypeptide motions and timescales that are relevant to the various folding stages. The folding barriers estimated with a variety of independent methods are consistently small, indicating that several fast-folding proteins are near or within the downhill folding regime. Finally, the structural and statistical analysis of global downhill folding is promising to open a new avenue of research in which folding mechanisms and the networks of noncovalent interactions that stabilize native structures are directly resolved in equilibrium experiments of nonmutated proteins.},

abstract = {Recently single molecule photoemission statistics have been measured with a nanosecond time resolution for a pair of dye molecules attached to a DNA molecule and undergoing fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) [Berglund, A. J.; Doherty, A. C.; Mabuchi, H. Phys. ReV. Lett. 2002, 89, 068101]. We have simulated single molecule photoemission in a model, where a FRET pair resides on a polypeptide molecule that undergoes diffusion in water, with the goal to understand how the dynamics of the molecule are reflected in the observed photoemission statistics. We further compare our simulation results with the classical theory of Haas and Steinberg [Haas, E.; Steinberg, I. Z. Biophys. J. 1984, 46, 429] and find that their approximation, while not quantitative in the case of fast diffusion in water, predicts well many of the qualitative features of the single molecule photoemission signal. The calculated second-order intensity autocorrelation functions exhibit photon antibunching at short times and photon bunching at longer times, the latter being crucially dependent on the time scales of intramolecular diffusion as well as on the properties of the FRET pair. Our study establishes potentially useful guidelines for the choice of FRET pairs for the experimental study of specific systems.},

abstract = {We report a novel method for estimating fluorescence impulse response function (fIRF) from noise-corrupted time-domain fluorescence measurements of biological tissue. This method is based on the use of high-order Laguerre basis functions and a constrained least-squares approach that addresses the problem of overfitting due to increased model complexity. The new method was extensively evaluated on fluorescence data from simulation, fluorescent standard dyes, ex vivo tissue samples of atherosclerotic plaques and in vivo oral carcinoma. Current results demonstrate that this method allows for rapid and accurate deconvolution of multiple channel fluorescence decays without adaptively adjusting the Laguerre scale parameter. The appropriate choice of the scale parameter is essential for accurate estimation of the fIRF. The method described here is anticipated to play an important role in the development of computational techniques for real-time analysis of time-resolved fluorescence data from biological tissues and to support the advancement of fluorescence lifetime instrumentation for biomedical diagnostics by providing a means for on-line robust analysis of fluorescence decay.},

abstract = {We study protein and nucleic acid structure and dynamics using single-molecule FRET and alternating-laser excitation. Freely diffusing molecules are sorted into subpopulations based on single-molecule signals detected within 100 micros to 1 ms. Distance distributions caused by fluctuations faster than 100 micros are studied within these subpopulations by using time-correlated single-photon counting. Measured distance distributions for dsDNA can be accounted for by considering fluorophore linkers and fluorophore rotational diffusion, except that we find smaller fluctuations for internally labeled dsDNA than DNA with one of the fluorophores positioned at a terminal site. We find that the electrostatic portion of the persistence length of short single-stranded poly(dT) varies approximately as the ionic strength (I) to the -1/2 power (I(-1/2)), and that the average contribution to the contour length per base is 0.40-0.45 nm. We study unfolded chymotrypsin inhibitor 2 (CI2) and unfolded acyl-CoA binding protein (ACBP) even under conditions where folded and unfolded subpopulations coexist (contributions from folded proteins are excluded by using alternating-laser excitation). At lower denaturant concentrations, unfolded CI2 and ACBP are more compact and display larger fluctuations than at higher denaturant concentrations where only unfolded proteins are present. The experimentally measured fluctuations are larger than the fluctuations predicted from a Gaussian chain model or a wormlike chain model. We propose that the larger fluctuations may indicate transient residual structure in the unfolded state.},

abstract = {We recently showed that bulged bases kink duplex DNA, with the degree of kinking increasing in roughly equal increments as the number of bases in the bulge increases from one to four [Hsieh, C.-H., \& Griffith, J.D. (1989) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 86, 4833-4837]. Here we have examined the kinking of DNA by single A, C, G, or T bulges with different neighboring base pairs. Synthetic 30 base pair (bp) duplex DNAs containing 2 single-base bulges spaced by 10 bp were ligated head to tail, and their electrophoretic behavior in highly cross-linked gels was examined. All bulge-containing DNAs showed marked electrophoretic retardations as compared to non-bulge-containing DNA. Regardless of the sequence of the flanking base pairs, purine bulges produced greater retardations than pyrimidine bulges. Furthermore, C and T bulges produced the same retardations as did G and A bulges. Bulged DNA containing different flanking base pairs showed marked differences in electrophoretic mobility. For C-bulged DNA, the greatest retardations were observed with G.C neighbors, the least with T.A neighbors, and an intermediate amount with a mixture of neighboring base pairs. For A-bulged DNA, the retardations were greatest with G.C neighbors, less with T.A neighbors, even less with a mixture of neighboring base pairs, and finally least with C.G neighbors. Thus flanking base pairs affect C-bulged DNA and A-bulged DNA differently, and G.C and C.G flanking base pairs were seen to have very different effects. These results imply an important role of base stacking in determining how neighboring base pairs influence the kinking of DNA by a single-base bulge.},

abstract = {The addition of polyethylene glycol (PEG), of various molecular weights, to solutions bathing yeast hexokinase increases the affinity of the enzyme for its substrate glucose. The results can be interpreted on the basis that PEG acts directly on the protein or indirectly through water activity. The nature of the effects suggests to us that PEG's action is indirect. Interpretation of the results as an osmotic effect yields a decrease in the number of water molecules, delta Nw, associated with the glucose binding reaction. delta Nw is the difference in the number of PEG-inaccessible water molecules between the glucose-bound and glucose-free conformations of hexokinase. At low PEG concentrations, delta Nw increases from 50 to 326 with increasing MW of the PEG from 300 to 1000, and then remains constant for MW-PEG up to 10,000. This suggests that up to MW 1000, solutes of increasing size are excluded from ever larger aqueous compartments around the protein. Three hundred and twenty-six waters is larger than is estimated from modeling solvent volumes around the crystal structures of the two hexokinase conformations. For PEGs of MW > 1000, delta Nw falls from 326 to about 25 waters with increasing PEG concentration, i.e., PEG alone appears to "dehydrate" the unbound conformation of hexokinase in solution. Remarkably, the osmotic work of this dehydration would be on the order of only one k T per hexokinase molecule. We conclude that under thermal fluctuations, hexokinase in solution has a conformational flexibility that explores a wide range of hydration states not seen in the crystal structure.},

abstract = {The transition from initiation to elongation of the RNA polymerase (RNAP) is an important stage of transcription that often limits the production of the full-length RNA. Little is known about the RNAP transition kinetics and the steps that dictate the transition rate, because of the challenge in monitoring subpopulations of the transient and heterogeneous transcribing complexes in rapid and real time. Here, we have dissected the complete transcription initiation pathway of T7 RNAP by using kinetic modeling of RNA synthesis and by determining the initiation (IC) to elongation (EC) transition kinetics at each RNA polymerization step using single-molecule and stopped-flow FRET methods. We show that the conversion of IC to EC in T7 RNAP consensus promoter occurs only after 8- to 12-nt synthesis, and the 12-nt synthesis represents a critical juncture in the transcriptional initiation pathway when EC formation is most efficient. We show that the slow steps of transcription initiation, including DNA scrunching/RNAP-promoter rotational changes during 5- to 8-nt synthesis, not the major conformational changes, dictate the overall rate of EC formation in T7 RNAP and represent key steps that regulate the synthesis of full-length RNA.},

abstract = {Photon bursts from single diffusing donor-acceptor labeled macromolecules were used to measure intramolecular distances and identify subpopulations of freely diffusing macromolecules in a heterogeneous ensemble. By using DNA as a rigid spacer, a series of constructs with varying intramolecular donor-acceptor spacings were used to measure the mean and distribution width of fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) efficiencies as a function of distance. The mean single-pair FRET efficiencies qualitatively follow the distance dependence predicted by F\"{o}rster theory. Possible contributions to the widths of the FRET efficiency distributions are discussed, and potential applications in the study of biopolymer conformational dynamics are suggested. The ability to measure intramolecular (and intermolecular) distances for single molecules implies the ability to distinguish and monitor subpopulations of molecules in a mixture with different distances or conformational states. This is demonstrated by monitoring substrate and product subpopulations before and after a restriction endonuclease cleavage reaction. Distance measurements at single-molecule resolution also should facilitate the study of complex reactions such as biopolymer folding. To this end, the denaturation of a DNA hairpin was examined by using single-pair FRET.},

abstract = {Switchable FRET is the combination of single-molecule F\"{o}rster resonance energy transfer (smFRET) with photoswitching, the reversible activation and deactivation of fluorophores by light. By photoswitching, multiple donor-acceptor fluorophore pairs can be probed sequentially, thus allowing observation of multiple distances within a single immobilized molecule. Control of the photoinduced switching rates permits adjustment of the temporal resolution of switchable FRET over a wide range of timescales, thereby facilitating application to various dynamical biological systems. We show that fast total internal reflection (TIRF) microscopy can achieve measurements of two FRET pairs with 10 ms temporal resolution within less than 2 s. The concept of switchable FRET is also compatible with confocal microscopy on immobilized molecules, providing better data quality at high temporal resolution. To identify states and extract their transitions from switchable FRET time traces, we also develop linked hidden Markov modeling (HMM) of both FRET and donor-acceptor stoichiometry. Linked HMM successfully identifies transient states in the two-dimensional FRET-stoichiometry space and reconstructs their connectivity network. Improved temporal resolution and novel data analysis make switchable FRET a valuable tool in molecular and structural biology.},

For molecular dynamics to be described by a Markov process, the Markov process must include all states involved in the dynamics and the FPT distributions out of those states must be describable by a simple exponential law. The observation of non-exponential first-passage time distributions or other evidence of non-Markovian dynamics is common in single molecule studies and offers an opportunity to expand the Markov model to include new dynamics or states that improve understanding of the system.},

abstract = {Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) under in vivo conditions is a well-established technique for the evaluation of populations of protein bound/unbound nucleic acid (NA) molecules or NA hybridization kinetics. However, in vivo FRET has not been applied to in vivo quantitative conformational analysis of NA thus far. Here we explored parameters critical for characterization of NA structure using single-pair (sp)FRET in the complex cellular environment of a living Escherichia coli cell. Our measurements showed that the fluorophore properties in the cellular environment differed from those acquired under in vitro conditions. The precision for the interprobe distance determination from FRET efficiency values acquired in vivo was found lower (≈ 31\%) compared to that acquired in diluted buffers (13\%). Our numerical simulations suggest that despite its low precision, the in-cell FRET measurements can be successfully applied to discriminate among various structural models. The main advantage of the in-cell spFRET setup presented here over other established techniques allowing conformational analysis in vivo is that it allows investigation of NA structure in various cell types and in a native cellular environment, which is not disturbed by either introduced bulk NA or by the use of chemical transfectants.},

abstract = {In this work, we develop a fully Bayesian method for the calculation of probability distributions of single-exponential rates for any single-molecule process. These distributions can even be derived when no transitions from one state to another have been observed, since in that case the data can be used to estimate a lower bound on the rate. Using a Bayesian hypothesis test, one can easily test whether a transition occurs at the same rate or at different rates in two data sets. We illustrate these methods with molecular dynamics simulations of the folding of a beta-sheet protein. However, the theory presented here can be used on any data from simulation or experiment for which a two-state description is appropriate.},

These dyes, which contain iodoacetamide functional groups, have high extinction coefficients and moderate quantum yields. A major advantage of these polymethine dyes is the easy manipulation of their spectral properties during synthesis. Cyanines containing reactive functional groups can be made with absorption maxima ranging from less than 500 nm to greater than 750 nm. This property opens additional regions of the spectrum for experiments involving the simultaneous multicolor analysis of different fluorescent probes. The cyanines, which are relatively insensitive to solvent property changes, are complemented by the merocyanines, which are keen indicators of solvent polarity.},

abstract = {Network data-transfer times in distributed simulation environments can be reduced by performing data analysis at the remote source, if the analytical technique does not require the entire set of data at once. This novel multi-tau autocorrelation algorithm allows time-domain data records to be processed in discrete, distributed segments and combined at a later point in time. The new approach agrees with autocorrelation results performed by concatenating the discrete segments before correlation, but it operates with significantly shortened processing times. The multi-tau algorithm also benefits from reduced memory requirements since it does not require access to the entire data record at once, and from improved scalability since the multi-tau algorithm has order O(N), while fast Fourier transform autocorrelation algorithms have order O(N log N). This distributed algorithm has particular utility in simulations of fluorescence correlation spectroscopy or photon correlation spectroscopy.},

@article{Hardin1992,
abstract = {The DNA oligonucleotide d(CGCG3GCG) can form either a Watson-Crick (WC) hairpin or a parallel-stranded quadruplex structure containing six G-quartet base pair assemblies. The exchange between these forms and single strands can be monitored using circular dichroism (CD). NMR results verified the assignment of specific CD bands to quadruplex and hairpin species, respectively. Cations stabilize the quadruplex in the order K+ greater than Ca2+ greater than Na+ greater than Mg2+ greater than Li+ and K+ greater than Rb+ greater than Cs+, indicating that K+ has an optimum ionic radius for complex formation and that ionic charge affects the extent of ion-induced stabilization. The quadruplex is stable in the presence of 40 mM K+ at micromolar DNA concentration and can be kinetically trapped as a metastable form when prepared at millimolar DNA concentration and then diluted into buffer containing 40 mM Na+. The concentration of K+ required to reverse the equilibrium from the hairpin to the quadruplex decreases sharply with increased DNA concentration. The quadruplex has an unusual pKa of ca. 6.8, indicating that C.C+ base pairs are probably forming. This system provides insights into some of the detailed structural characteristics of a ["G4-DNA".ion] complex and an experimental model for the recently proposed "sodium-potassium conformational switch" [Sen, D., \& Gilbert, W. (1988) Nature 334, 364-366; Sen, D., \& Gilbert, W. (1990) Nature 344, 410-414]. These results may help to explain the lack of cytidine residues in G-rich telomeric DNAs and suggest that methylation of GC-rich duplex DNAs in "GpC islands" may induce quadruplex formation within heterochromatin domains, resulting in reversible chromosomal condensation.},

abstract = {We have measured the bending elasticity of short double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) chains through small-angle x-ray scattering from solutions of dsDNA-linked dimers of gold nanoparticles. This method, which does not require exertion of external forces or binding to a substrate, reports on the equilibrium distribution of bending fluctuations, not just an average value (as in ensemble fluorescence resonance energy transfer) or an extreme value (as in cyclization), and in principle provides a more robust data set for assessing the suitability of theoretical models. Our experimental results for dsDNA comprising 42-94 basepairs are consistent with a simple wormlike chain model of dsDNA elasticity, whose behavior we have determined from Monte Carlo simulations that explicitly represent nanoparticles and their alkane tethers. A persistence length of 50 nm (150 basepairs) gave a favorable comparison, consistent with the results of single-molecule force-extension experiments on much longer dsDNA chains, but in contrast to recent suggestions of enhanced flexibility at these length scales.},

abstract = {Biopolymers, such as single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), are often described as semiflexible polymers or wormlike chains. We investigated the length dependence of diffusional properties of homogeneous ssDNA (polythymine) with up to 100 nucleotides using fluorescence correlation spectroscopy. We found that the hydrodynamic radius Rh scales according to a power law, with an exponent between 0.5 and 0.7 depending on ionic strength I. With Rh being proportional to the square root of the persistence length Lp, we found that Lp approximately Im, with m=-0.22+/-0.01 for polythymine with 100 residues. For comparison, we performed molecular dynamics (MD) simulations with a force field that accounts for short-range interactions in vacuum, and determined the characteristic polymer properties end-to-end distance R, radius of gyration S, and persistence length Lp of various labeled and nonlabeled polythymine derivatives. We found excellent agreement for the length dependence of simulated S and experimental Rh measured at 100 mM NaCl, revealing that electrostatic interactions are completely shielded in aqueous solution at such ionic strength. MD simulations further showed that polythymine with >approximately 30 residues can be described as a semiflexible polymer with negligible influence of the fluorescent label; and that static flexibility is limited by geometrical and steric constraints as expressed by an intrinsic persistence length of approximately 1.7 nm. These results provide a benchmark for theories and MD simulations describing the influence of electrostatic interactions on polyelectrolyte properties, and thus help to develop a complete and accurate description of ssDNA.},

@article{Andrec2003,
abstract = {The measurement of fluorescence from single protein molecules has become an important new tool in the study of dynamic processes, allowing for the direct visualization of the motions experienced by individual proteins and macromolecular complexes. The data from such single-molecule experiments are in the form of photon trajectories, consisting of arrival times and wavelength information on individual photons. The analysis of photon trajectories can be difficult, particularly if the motions are occurring at rates comparable to the photon arrival rate or in the presence of noise. In this paper, we introduce the use of hidden Markov models (HMMs) for the analysis of photon trajectory data that operate using the photon data directly, without the need for ensemble averaging of the data as implied by correlation function analysis. Using a simple kinetic model, we examine the relationship between the uncertainty in the estimates of the motional rate and the photon detection rate. Remarkably, we obtain relative uncertainties in the rate constants of as little as 3\% even when the interconversion rate is equal to the photon detection rate, and the uncertainty increases to only 10\% when the interconversion rate is 10 times the photon detection rate. This suggests that useful information can be obtained for much faster kinetic regimes than have typically been studied. We also examine the impact of background photons on the determination of the rate and demonstrate that the HMM-based approach is robust, displaying small uncertainties for background photon arrival rates approaching that of the signal. These results not only are relevant in establishing the theoretical limits on precision, but are also useful in the context of experimental design. Finally, to demonstrate how the methodology can be extended to more complex kinetic models and how it can allow one to make use of the full power of statistics for purposes of model evaluation and selection, we consider a four-state kinetic model for protein conformational transitions previously studied by Schenter et al. (J. Phys. Chem. A1999, 103, 10477). We show how an HMM can be used as an alternative to higher-order correlation function analysis for the detection of "conformational memory" and apparent non-Markovian dynamics arising from such temporally inhomogeneous kinetic schemes.},

The natural role and biological validation of these structures is starting to be explored, and there is particular interest in them as targets for therapeutic intervention. This survey focuses on the folding and structural features on quadruplexes formed from telomeric and non-telomeric DNA sequences, and examines fundamental aspects of topology and the emerging relationships with sequence. Emphasis is placed on information from the high-resolution methods of X-ray crystallography and NMR, and their scope and current limitations are discussed. Such information, together with biological insights, will be important for the discovery of drugs targeting quadruplexes from particular genes.},

Near-field scanning optical microscopy (NSOM) is used to obtain simultaneous dual color images and emission spectra from donor and acceptor fluorophores linked by a short DNA molecule. Photodestruction dynamics of the donor or acceptor are used to determine the presence and efficiency of energy transfer. The classical equations used to measure energy transfer on ensembles of fluorophores are modified for single-molecule measurements. In contrast to ensemble measurements, dynamic events on a molecular scale are observable in single pair FRET measurements because they are not canceled out by random averaging. Monitoring conformational changes, such as rotations and distance changes on a nanometer scale, within single biological macromolecules, may be possible with single pair FRET.},

abstract = {Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) is one of the major biophysical techniques used for unraveling molecular interactions in vitro and in vivo. It allows minimally invasive study of dynamic processes in biological specimens with extremely high temporal and spatial resolution. By recording and correlating the fluorescence fluctuations of single labeled molecules through the exciting laser beam, FCS gives information on molecular mobility and photophysical and photochemical reactions. By using dual-color fluorescence cross-correlation, highly specific binding studies can be performed. These have been extended to four reaction partners accessible by multicolor applications. Alternative detection schemes shift accessible time frames to slower processes (e.g., scanning FCS) or higher concentrations (e.g., TIR-FCS). Despite its long tradition, FCS is by no means dated. Rather, it has proven to be a highly versatile technique that can easily be adapted to solve specific biological questions, and it continues to find exciting applications in biology and medicine.},

abstract = {Molecular dynamics simulations were used to examine the structural dynamics of two fluorescent probes attached to a typical protein, hen egg-white lysozyme (HEWL). The donor probe (D) was attached via a succinimide group, consistent with the commonly-used maleimide conjugation chemistry, and the acceptor probe (A) was bound into the protein as occurs naturally for HEWL and the dye Eosin Y. The <kappa(2)> is found to deviate significantly from the theoretical value and high correlation between the orientation factor kappa and the distance R is observed. The correlation is quantified using several possible fixed A orientations and correlation as high as 0.80 is found between kappa and R and as high as 0.68 between kappa(2) and R. The presence of this correlation highlights the fact that essentially all fluorescence-detected resonance energy transfer studies have assumed that kappa and R are independent--an assumption that is clearly not justified in the system studied here. The correlation results in the quantities <kappa(2)R(-)(6)> and <kappa(2)> < R(-)(6)> differing by a factor of 1.6. The observed correlation between kappa and R is caused by the succinimide linkage between the D and HEWL, which is found to be relatively inflexible.},

abstract = {Gene-regulatory complexes often require that pairs of DNA-bound proteins interact by looping-out short (often approximately 100-bp) stretches of DNA. The loops can vary in detailed length and sequence and, thus, in total helical twist, which radically alters their geometry. How this variability is accommodated structurally is not known. Here we show that the inherent twistability of 89- to 105-bp DNA circles exceeds theoretical expectation by up to 400-fold. These results can be explained only by greatly enhanced DNA flexibility, not by permanent bends. They invalidate the use of classic theories of flexibility for understanding sharp DNA looping but support predictions of two recent theories. Our findings imply an active role for DNA flexibility in loop formation and suggest that variability in the detailed helical twist of regulatory loops is accommodated naturally by the inherent twistability of the DNA.},

abstract = {Fluorescence fluctuation methods such as fluorescence correlation spectroscopy and fluorescence intensity distribution analysis (FIDA) have proven to be versatile tools for studying molecular interactions with single molecule sensitivity. Another well-known fluorescence technique is the measurement of the fluorescence lifetime. Here, we introduce a method that combines the benefits of both FIDA and fluorescence lifetime analysis. It is based on fitting the two-dimensional histogram of the number of photons detected in counting time intervals of given width and the sum of excitation to detection delay times of these photons. Referred to as fluorescence intensity and lifetime distribution analysis (FILDA), the technique distinguishes fluorescence species on the basis of both their specific molecular brightness and the lifetime of the excited state and is also able to determine absolute fluorophore concentrations. The combined information yielded by FILDA results in significantly increased accuracy compared to that of FIDA or fluorescence lifetime analysis alone. In this paper, the theory of FILDA is elaborated and applied to both simulated and experimental data. The outstanding power of this technique in resolving different species is shown by quantifying the binding of calmodulin to a peptide ligand, thus indicating the potential for application of FILDA to similar problems in the life sciences.},

abstract = {Many proteins "bind" DNA through positively charged amino acids on their surfaces. However, to overcome significant energetic and topological obstacles, proteins that bend or package DNA might also modulate the stiffness that is generated by repulsions between phosphates within DNA. Much previous work describes how ions change the flexibility of DNA in solution, but when considering macromolecules such as chromatin in which the DNA contacts the nucleosome core each turn of the double helix, it may be more appropriate to assess the flexibility of DNA on charged surfaces. Mica coated with positively charged molecules is a convenient substrate upon which the flexibility of DNA may be directly measured with a scanning force microscope. In the experiments described below, the flexibility of DNA increased as much as fivefold depending on the concentration and type of polyamine used to coat mica. Using theory that relates charge neutralization to flexibility, we predict that phosphate repulsions were attenuated by approximately 50\% in the most flexible DNA observed. This simple method is an important tool for investigating the physiochemical causes and molecular biological effects of DNA flexibility, which affects DNA biochemistry ranging from chromatin stability to viral encapsulation.},

abstract = {F\"{o}rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) is a powerful optical technique to determine intra-molecular distances. However, the dye rotational motion and the linker flexibility complicate the relationship between the measured energy transfer efficiency and the distance between the anchoring points of the dyes. In this study, we present a simple model that describes the linker and dye dynamics as diffusion on a sphere. Single-pair energy transfer was treated in the weak excitation limit, photon statistics and scaffold flexibility were ignored, and different time-averaging regimes were considered. Despite the approximations, our model provides new insights for experimental designs and results interpretation in single-molecule FRET. Monte Carlo simulations produced distributions of the inter-dye distance, the dipole orientation factor, $\kappa$(2), and the transfer efficiency, E, which were in perfect agreement with independently derived theoretical functions. Contrary to common perceptions, our data show that longer linkers will actually restrict the motion of dye dipoles and hence worsen the isotropic 2∕3 approximation of $\kappa$(2). It is also found that the thermal motions of the dye-linker system cause fast and large efficiency fluctuations, as shown by the simulated FRET time-trajectories binned on a microsecond time scale. A fundamental resolution limit of single-molecule FRET measurements emerges around 1-10 $\mu$s, which should be considered for the interpretation of data recorded on such fast time scales.},

abstract = {DNA dodecamers have been designed with two cytosines on each end and intervening A and T stretches, such that the oligomers have fully complementary A:T base pairs when aligned in the parallel orientation. Spectroscopic (UV, CD and IR), NMR and molecular dynamics studies have shown that oligomers having the sequences d(CCATAATTTACC) and d(CCTATTAAATCC) form a parallel-stranded duplex when dissolved at 1:1 stoichiometry in aqueous solution. This is due to the C:C+ clamps on either end and extensive mismatches in the antiparallel orientation. The structure is stable at neutral and acidic pH. At higher temperatures, the duplex melts into single strands in a highly cooperative fashion. All adenine, cytosine and thymine nucleotides adopt the anti conformation with respect to the glycosidic bond. The A:T base pairs form reverse Watson-Crick base pairs. The duplex shows base stacking and NOEs between the base protons T(H6)/A(H8) and the sugar protons (H1'/H2'/H2") of the preceding nucleotide, as has been observed in antiparallel duplexes. However, no NOEs are observed between base protons H2/H6/H8 of sequential nucleotides, though such NOEs are observed between T(CH3) and A(H8). A three-dimensional structure of the parallel-stranded duplex at atomic resolution has been obtained using molecular dynamics simulations under NMR constraints. The simulated structures have torsional angles very similar to those found in B-DNA duplexes, but the base stacking and helicoid parameters are significantly different.},

abstract = {The human telomere is known to form the G-quadruplex structure to inhibit the activity of telomerase. Its detailed structure has been of great interest. Recently, two kinds of the parallel-antiparallel hybrid structures have been specified in K(+) solution. However, the G-quadruplex structure is generally thought to be in equilibrium among different structures. Here, we describe the single-pair fluorescence resonance energy transfer (sp-FRET) experiments on telomere samples with bromoguanine (BrG)-substitutions, which control the G-quadruplex structures, at different positions and one without any substitution. The observed FRET distributions were decomposed into five components and the relative population of these components depended on the BrG-substitution positions. In order to consistently explain the variety of conformations, we proposed a novel structural model, the so-called triple-strand-core model. On the basis of this model, the components of the FRET distributions were attributed to the mixed-chair hybrid structures, which were reported recently, and chair-type antiparallel structures, which can be predicted from this model. The FRET efficiencies of these structures were explained in terms of partially broken structures due to steric hindrance and inappropriate capping. This basic model also consistently explains experimental results reported previously. Furthermore, using this model, the folding pathway of the hybrid structures and T-loop formation can be predicted.},

abstract = {Fluorescence modulation offers the opportunity to detect low-concentration fluorophore signals within high background. Applicable from the single-molecule to bulk levels, we demonstrate long-wavelength optical depopulation of dark states that otherwise limit Cy5 fluorescence intensity. By modulated excitation of a long-wavelength Cy5 transient absorption, we dynamically modulate Cy5 emission. The frequency dependence enables specification of the dark-state timescales enabling optical-demodulation-based signal recovery from high background. These dual-laser illumination schemes for high-sensitivity fluorescence-signal recovery easily improve signal-to-noise ratios by well over an order of magnitude, largely by discrimination against background. Previously limited to very specialized dyes, our utilization of long-lived dark states in Cy5 enables selective detection of this very common single-molecule and bulk fluorophore. Although, in principle, the "dark state" can arise from any photoinduced process, we demonstrate that cis-trans photoisomerization, with its unique transient absorption and lifetime enables this sensitivity boosting, long-wavelength modulation to occur in Cy5. Such studies underscore the need for transient absorption studies on common fluorophores to extend the impact of fluorescence modulation for high-sensitivity fluorescence imaging in a much wider array of applications.},

abstract = {A combination of conformational search, energy minimization, and energetic evaluation using a continuum solvent treatment has been employed to study the stability of various conformations of the DNA fragment d(CGCAGAA)/d(TTCGCG) containing a single adenine bulge. The extra-helical (looped-out) bulge conformation derived from a published x-ray structure and intra-helical (stacked bulge base) model structures partially based on nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) data were used as start structures for the conformational search. Solvent-dependent contributions to the stability of the conformations were calculated from the solvent exposed molecular surface area and by using the finite difference Poisson-Boltzmann approach. Three classes (I-III) of bulge conformations with calculated low energies can be distinguished. The lowest-energy conformations were found in class I, corresponding to structures with the bulge base stacked between flanking helices, and class II, composed of structures forming a triplet of the bulge base and a flanking base pair. All extra-helical bulge structures, forming class III, were found to be less stable compared with the lowest energy structures of class I and II. The results are consistent with NMR data on an adenine bulge in the same sequence context indicating an intra-helical or triplet bulge conformation in solution. Although the total energies and total electrostatic energies of the low-energy conformations show only relatively modest variations, the energetic contributions to the stability were found to vary significantly among the classes of bulge structures. All intra-helical bulge structures are stabilized by a more favorable Coulomb charge-charge interaction but destabilized by a larger electrostatic reaction field contribution compared with all extra-helical and most triplet bulge structures. Van der Waals packing interactions and nonpolar surface-area-dependent contributions appear to favor triplet class II structures and to a lesser degree also the intra-helical stacked bulge conformations. The large conformational variation found for class III conformers might add a favorable entropic contribution to the stability of the extra-helical bulge form.},

abstract = {DNA with tandem repeats of guanines folds into G-quadruplexes made of a stack of G-quartets. In vitro, G-quadruplex formation inhibits telomere extension, and POT1 binding to the single-stranded telomeric DNA enhances telomerase activity by disrupting the G-quadruplex structure, highlighting the potential importance of the G-quadruplex structure in regulating telomere length in vivo. We have used single-molecule spectroscopy to probe the dynamics of human telomeric DNA. Three conformations were observed in potassium solution, one unfolded and two folded, and each conformation could be further divided into two species, long-lived and short-lived, based on lifetimes of minutes vs. seconds. Vesicle encapsulation studies suggest that the total of six states detected here is intrinsic to the DNA. Folding was severely hindered by replacing a single guanine, showing only the shortlived species. The long-lived folded states are dominant in physiologically relevant conditions and probably correspond to the parallel and antiparallel G-quadruplexes seen in high-resolution structural studies. Although rare under these conditions, the short-lived species determine the overall dynamics because they bridge the different long-lived species. We propose that these previously unobserved transient states represent the early and late intermediates toward the formation of stable G-quadruplexes. The major compaction occurs between the early and late intermediates, and it is possible that local rearrangements are sufficient in locking the late intermediates into the stably folded forms. The extremely diverse conformations of the human telomeric DNA may have mechanistic implications for the proteins and drugs that recognize G-rich sequences.},

Analytic expressions for the factorial cumulants of photon counts are obtained. For an arbitrary counting time window, it is shown how the exact histograms can be obtained by solving an appropriate reaction-diffusion equation. Our formalism reduces correctly when the molecules are immobile. The approximation used in fluorescence intensity multiple distribution analysis (FIMDA) is tested against the exact numerical solution of the problem. FIMDA works very well for a wide range of parameters except for small concentrations and long time windows.},

abstract = {Ionizing radiation damages DNA in several ways, including through formation of a single-nucleoside gap in one DNA strand. We have developed a two-dimensional gel electrophoresis method to investigate the effect of a strand gap on DNA structure. We generate a library of gapped DNA molecules by treating a DNA restriction fragment with the hydroxyl radical, generated by the reaction of Fe(II) EDTA with hydrogen peroxide. The DNA molecule studied contains a fixed bend produced by a set of phased adenine tracts. The A-tract bend serves as a reference bend for investigating the conformational nature of a strand gap. In the first electrophoretic dimension, a bent DNA molecule that has been treated with the hydroxyl radical is electrophoresed on a native gel. Smearing of the band on the native gel indicates that the library of gapped DNA molecules contains a variety of DNA conformations. In the second electrophoretic dimension, gapped DNA molecules having different native gel mobilities are electrophoresed on separate lanes of a denaturing gel to reveal how each strand gap affects the native gel mobility (and thus shape) of the DNA. Our results demonstrate that a single-nucleoside gap in a DNA duplex leads to an anisotropic, directional bend in the DNA helix axis. The implications of our findings for recognition of this lesion by DNA repair proteins are discussed.},

abstract = {The persistence length of DNA, a, depends both on the intrinsic curvature of the double helix and on the thermal fluctuations of the angles between adjacent base-pairs. We have evaluated two contributions to the value of a by comparing measured values of a for DNA containing a generic sequence and for an "intrinsically straight" DNA. In each 10 bp segment of the intrinsically straight DNA an initial sequence of five bases is repeated in the sequence of the second five bases, so any bends in the first half of the segment are compensated by bends in the opposite direction in the second half. The value of a for the latter DNA depends, to a good approximation, on thermal fluctuations only; there is no intrinsic curvature. The values of a were obtained from measurements of the cyclization efficiency for short DNA fragments, about 200 bp in length. This method determines the persistence length of DNA with exceptional accuracy, due to the very strong dependence of the cyclization efficiency of short fragments on the value of a. We find that the values of a for the two types of DNA fragment are very close and conclude that the contribution of the intrinsic curvature to a is at least 20 times smaller than the contribution of thermal fluctuations. The relationship between this result and the angles between adjacent base-pairs, which specify the intrinsic curvature, is analyzed.},

The algorithm is based on rewriting the correlation as a counting operation on photon pairs and can be used with arbitrary bin widths and spacing. The flexibility of the algorithm is demonstrated by use of FCS simulations and single-molecule photon antibunching experiments. Execution speed is comparable to the commonly used multiple-tau correlation technique. Wide bin spacings are possible that allow for real-time software calculation of correlations, even for high count rates.},

abstract = {Cy3B is an extremely bright and stable fluorescent dye, which is only available for coupling to nucleic acids post-synthetically. This severely limits its use in the fields of genomics, biology and nanotechnology. We have optimized the synthesis of Cy3B, and for the first time produced a diverse range of Cy3B monomers for use in solid-phase oligonucleotide synthesis. This molecular toolkit includes phosphoramidite monomers with Cy3B linked to deoxyribose, to the 5-position of thymine, and to a hexynyl linker, in addition to an oligonucleotide synthesis resin in which Cy3B is linked to deoxyribose. These monomers have been used to incorporate single and multiple Cy3B units into oligonucleotides internally and at both termini. Cy3B Taqman probes, Scorpions and HyBeacons have been synthesized and used successfully in mutation detection, and a dual Cy3B Molecular Beacon was synthesized and found to be superior to the corresponding Cy3B/DABCYL Beacon. Attachment of Cy3, Cy3B and Cy5 to the 5-position of thymidine by an ethynyl linker enabled the synthesis of an oligonucleotide FRET system. The rigid linker between the dye and nucleobase minimizes dye-dye and dye-DNA interactions and reduces fluorescence quenching. These reagents open up new future applications of Cy3B, including more sensitive single-molecule and cell-imaging studies.},

abstract = {During the past decade, the issue of strong bending of the double helix has attracted a lot of attention. Here, we overview the major experimental and theoretical developments in the field sorting out reliably established facts from speculations and unsubstantiated claims. Theoretical analysis shows that sharp bends or kinks have to facilitate strong bending of the double helix. It remains to be determined what is the critical curvature of DNA that prompts the appearance of the kinks. Different experimental and computational approaches to the problem are analyzed. We conclude that there is no reliable evidence that any anomalous behavior of the double helix happens when DNA fragments in the range of 100 bp are circularized without torsional stress. The anomaly starts at the fragment length of about 70 bp when sharp bends or kinks emerge in essentially every molecule. Experimental data and theoretical analysis suggest that kinks may represent openings of isolated base pairs, which had been experimentally detected in linear DNA molecules. The calculation suggests that although the probability of these openings in unstressed DNA is close to 10(-5), it increases sharply in small DNA circles reaching 1 open bp per circle of 70 bp.},

abstract = {Several important photophysical properties of the cyanine dye Cy3 have been determined by laser flash photolysis. The triplet-state absorption and photoisomerization of Cy3 are distinguished by using the heavy-atom effects and oxygen-induced triplet --> triplet energy transfer. Furthermore, the triplet-state extinction coefficient and quantum yield of Cy3 are also measured via triplet-triplet energy-transfer method and comparative actinometry, respectively. It is found that the triplet --> triplet (T1-->Tn) absorptions of trans-Cy3 largely overlap the ground-state absorption of cis-Cy3. Unlike what occurred in Cy5, we have not observed the triplet-state T1-->Tn absorption of cis-Cy3 and the phosphorescence from triplet state of cis-Cy3 following a singlet excitation (S0-S1) of trans-Cy3, indicating the absence of a lowest cis-triplet state as an isomerization intermediate upon excitation in Cy3.

abstract = {Organic fluorophores common to fluorescence-based investigations suffer from unwanted photophysical properties, including blinking and photobleaching, which limit their overall experimental performance. Methods to control such processes are particularly important for single-molecule fluorescence and fluorescence resonance energy transfer imaging where uninterrupted, stable fluorescence is paramount. Fluorescence and FRET-based assays have been carried out on dye-labeled DNA and RNA-based systems to quantify the effect of including small-molecule solution additives on the fluorescence and FRET behaviors of both cyanine and Alexa fluorophores. A detailed dwell time analysis of the fluorescence and FRET trajectories of more than 200,000 individual molecules showed that two compounds identified previously as triplet state quenchers, cyclooctatetraene, and Trolox, as well as 4-nitrobenzyl alcohol, act to favorably attenuate blinking, photobleaching, and influence the rate of photoresurrection in a concentration-dependent and context-dependent manner. In both biochemical systems examined, a unique cocktail of compounds was shown to be optimal for imaging performance. By simultaneously providing the most rapid and direct access to multiple photophysical kinetic parameters, smFRET imaging provides a powerful avenue for future investigations aimed at discovering new compounds, and effective combinations thereof. These efforts may ultimately facilitate tuning organic dye molecule performance according to each specific experimental demand.},

abstract = {In single-molecule FRET experiments with pulsed lasers, not only the colors of the photons but also the fluorescence lifetimes can be monitored. Although these quantities appear to be random, they are modulated by conformational dynamics. In order to extract information about such dynamics, we develop the theory of the joint distribution of FRET efficiencies and fluorescence lifetimes determined from bins (or bursts) of photons. Our starting point is a rigorous formal expression for the distribution of the numbers of donor and acceptor photons and donor lifetimes in a bin that treats the influence of conformational dynamics on all timescales. This formula leads to an analytic result for a two-state system interconverting on a timescale slower than the interphoton time and to an efficient simulation algorithm for multistate dynamics. The shape of the joint distribution contains more information about conformational dynamics than the FRET efficiency histogram alone. In favorable cases, the connectivity of the underlying conformational states can be determined directly by simple inspection of the projection of the joint distribution on the efficiency-lifetime plane.},

abstract = {Time-resolved single molecule fluorescence measurements may be used to probe the conformational dynamics of biological macromolecules. The best time resolution in such techniques will only be achieved by measuring the arrival times of individual photons at the detector. A general approach to the estimation of molecular parameters based on individual photon arrival times is presented. The amount of information present in a data set is quantified by the Fisher information, thereby providing a guide to deriving the basic equations relating measurement uncertainties and time resolution. Based on these information-theoretical considerations, a data analysis algorithm is presented that details the optimal analysis of single-molecule data. This method natively accounts and corrects for background photons and cross talk, and can scale to an arbitrary number of channels. By construction, and with corroboration from computer simulations, we show that this algorithm reaches the theoretical limit, extracting the maximal information out of the data. The bias inherent in the algorithm is considered and its implications for experimental design are discussed. The ideas underlying this approach are general and are expected to be applicable to any information-limited measurement.},

abstract = {Single-molecule spectroscopy can monitor transitions between two microscopic states when these transitions are associated with the emission of photons. A general formalism is developed for obtaining the statistics of such transitions from a microscopic model when the dynamics is described by master or rate equations or their continuum analog, multidimensional reaction-diffusion equations. The focus is on the distribution of the number of transitions during a fixed observation time, the distribution of times between transitions, and the corresponding correlation functions. It is shown how these quantities are related to each other and how they can be explicitly calculated in a straightforward way for both immobile and diffusing molecules. Our formalism reduces to renewal theory when the monitored transitions either go to or originate from a single state. The influence of dynamics slow compared with the time between monitored transitions is treated in a simple way, and the probability distributions are expressed in terms of Mandel-type formulas. The formalism is illustrated by a detailed analysis of the statistics of catalytic turnovers of enzymes. When the rates of conformational changes are slower than the catalytic rates which are in turn slower than the binding relaxation rate, (1) the mean number of turnovers is shown to have the classical Michaelis-Menten form, (2) the correlation function of the number of turnovers is a direct measure of the time scale of catalytic rate fluctuations, and (3) the distribution of the time between consecutive turnovers is determined by the steady-state distribution.},

abstract = {One of the key questions regarding intracellular diffusion is how the environment affects molecular mobility. Mostly, intracellular diffusion has been described as hindered, and the physical reasons for this behavior are: immobile barriers, molecular crowding, and binding interactions with immobile or mobile molecules. Using results from multi-photon fluorescence correlation spectroscopy, we describe how immobile barriers and crowding agents affect translational mobility. To study the hindrance produced by immobile barriers, we used sol-gels (silica nanostructures) that consist of a continuous solid phase and aqueous phase in which fluorescently tagged molecules diffuse. In the case of molecular crowding, translational mobility was assessed in increasing concentrations of 500 kDa dextran solutions. Diffusion of fluorescent tracers in both sol-gels and dextran solutions shows clear evidence of anomalous subdiffusion. In addition, data from the autocorrelation function were analyzed using the maximum entropy method as adapted to fluorescence correlation spectroscopy data and compared with the standard model that incorporates anomalous diffusion. The maximum entropy method revealed evidence of different diffusion mechanisms that had not been revealed using the anomalous diffusion model. These mechanisms likely correspond to nanostructuring in crowded environments and to the relative dimensions of the crowding agent with respect to the tracer molecule. Analysis with the maximum entropy method also revealed information about the degree of heterogeneity in the environment as reported by the behavior of diffusive molecules.},

abstract = {We establish a probability distribution analysis (PDA) method for the analysis of fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) signals to determine with high precision the originating value of a shot-noise-limited signal distribution. PDA theoretical distributions are calculated explicitly including crosstalk, stochastic variations, and background and represent the minimum width that a FRET distribution must have. In this way an unambiguous distinction is made between shot-noise distributions and distributions broadened by heterogeneities. This method simultaneously and effectively extracts highly resolved information from FRET distributions. The theoretical histograms match the exact profile of histograms generated from constant transfer efficiency experimental data with a chi2 near unity. The chi2 surface suggests an ultimate level of precision with FRET of < 1\% of the F\"{o}rster radius. Distributions of FRET signals in donor-acceptor-labeled DNA were unambiguously identified as being broader than shot-noise variations could explain. A model describing a Gaussian distribution of distances was tested with the PDA method and demonstrated 5 A inhomogeneities due to dye motions. The capability of this method to recover quantitative information from FRET distributions has potential applications for studying molecular conformations and dynamics. Potential sources for artifacts such as acceptor photobleaching, spectrally different observation volumes, and fluctuations of the F\"{o}rster radius are ruled out.},

abstract = {Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) is generally used to obtain information about the number of fluorescent particles in a small volume and the diffusion coefficient from the autocorrelation function of the fluorescence signal. Here we demonstrate that photon counting histogram (PCH) analysis constitutes a novel tool for extracting quantities from fluorescence fluctuation data, i.e., the measured photon counts per molecule and the average number of molecules within the observation volume. The photon counting histogram of fluorescence fluctuation experiments, in which few molecules are present in the excitation volume, exhibits a super-Poissonian behavior. The additional broadening of the PCH compared to a Poisson distribution is due to fluorescence intensity fluctuations. For diffusing particles these intensity fluctuations are caused by an inhomogeneous excitation profile and the fluctuations in the number of particles in the observation volume. The quantitative relationship between the detected photon counts and the fluorescence intensity reaching the detector is given by Mandel's formula. Based on this equation and considering the fluorescence intensity distribution in the two-photon excitation volume, a theoretical expression for the PCH as a function of the number of molecules in the excitation volume is derived. For a single molecular species two parameters are sufficient to characterize the histogram completely, namely the average number of molecules within the observation volume and the detected photon counts per molecule per sampling time epsilon. The PCH for multiple molecular species, on the other hand, is generated by successively convoluting the photon counting distribution of each species with the others. The influence of the excitation profile upon the photon counting statistics for two relevant point spread functions (PSFs), the three-dimensional Gaussian PSF conventionally employed in confocal detection and the square of the Gaussian-Lorentzian PSF for two photon excitation, is explicitly treated. Measured photon counting distributions obtained with a two-photon excitation source agree, within experimental error with the theoretical PCHs calculated for the square of a Gaussian-Lorentzian beam profile. We demonstrate and discuss the influence of the average number of particles within the observation volume and the detected photon counts per molecule per sampling interval upon the super-Poissonian character of the photon counting distribution.},

abstract = {DNA secondary structure plays an important role in biology, genotyping diagnostics, a variety of molecular biology techniques, in vitro-selected DNA catalysts, nanotechnology, and DNA-based computing. Accurate prediction of DNA secondary structure and hybridization using dynamic programming algorithms requires a database of thermodynamic parameters for several motifs including Watson-Crick base pairs, internal mismatches, terminal mismatches, terminal dangling ends, hairpins, bulges, internal loops, and multibranched loops. To make the database useful for predictions under a variety of salt conditions, empirical equations for monovalent and magnesium dependence of thermodynamics have been developed. Bimolecular hybridization is often inhibited by competing unimolecular folding of a target or probe DNA. Powerful numerical methods have been developed to solve multistate-coupled equilibria in bimolecular and higher-order complexes. This review presents the current parameter set available for making accurate DNA structure predictions and also points to future directions for improvement.},

abstract = {We have investigated the photophysical properties of backbone fluorescent DNA modifications with the goal of reducing many of the sources of uncertainty commonly encountered in Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET) measurements. We show that backbone modifications constrain rotational motions, providing a way by which the orientation of the dye can be controlled in a predictable manner, and reduce the uncertainties in donor-acceptor distance associated with the flexible linkers commonly used in conjugate chemistry. Rotational rigidity also prevents undesirable dye-DNA interactions, which have been shown to affect the photophysical properties of the dye. Unusually large FRET efficiencies for donor-acceptor pairs separated by 102 A (three helical turns) were measured and attributed to the favorable relative orientation of the dipoles. The same FRET efficiency was measured for a sample in which the donor-acceptor separation was 12 A shorter, demonstrating the important role of relative orientation in FRET experiments.},

abstract = {Probability distribution analysis (PDA) is a recently developed statistical tool for predicting the shapes of single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (smFRET) histograms, which allows the identification of single or multiple static molecular species within a single histogram. We used a generalized PDA method to predict the shapes of FRET histograms for molecules interconverting dynamically between multiple states. This method is tested on a series of model systems, including both static DNA fragments and dynamic DNA hairpins. By fitting the shape of this expected distribution to experimental data, the timescale of hairpin conformational fluctuations can be recovered, in good agreement with earlier published results obtained using different techniques. This method is also applied to studying the conformational fluctuations in the unliganded Klenow fragment (KF) of Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I, which allows both confirmation of the consistency of a simple, two-state kinetic model with the observed smFRET distribution of unliganded KF and extraction of a millisecond fluctuation timescale, in good agreement with rates reported elsewhere. We expect this method to be useful in extracting rates from processes exhibiting dynamic FRET, and in hypothesis-testing models of conformational dynamics against experimental data.},

abstract = {Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) is a spectroscopic means of obtaining distance information over a range up to \~{}80\AA in solution. It is based on the dipolar coupling between the electronic transition moments of a donor and acceptor fluorophore attached at known positions on the RNA species of interest. It can be applied in ensembles of molecules, either by steady-state fluorescence or by lifetime measurements, but it is also very appropriate for single-molecule studies. In addition to the provision of distance information, recent studies have emphasized the orientation dependence of energy transfer.},

abstract = {Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) is a powerful tool to gain information about dynamics of biomolecules. However, the key problem is to extract the rates hidden in the FCS data by fitting the data to a meaningful model. A number of different fitting approaches have been described in recent years but the extraction of relevant information to date has still been limited by numerous experimental problems and the fact that the set of starting parameter values chosen could often predefine the result. We establish a new way to globally analyze FCS data based on Bayesian inference to overcome these issues. Moreover, the influence of other remaining experimental error sources, for example, photophysics, is excluded by additional means. Using this approach in combination with the results from single-molecule burst analysis, we investigate the kinetics of DNA hairpins labeled with a variety of different fluorescent probes as a function of the salt concentration. We find that the rates of hairpin opening and closing as well as the equilibrium constant of the transition depend on the characteristics of the dye molecules used to label the hairpin. Thus, great caution has to be used when utilizing dye molecules as reporters for the kinetics of dynamic macromolecular structures.},

abstract = {We demonstrate that commercially available unmodified carbocyanine dyes such as Cy5 (usually excited at 633 nm) can be used as efficient reversible single-molecule optical switch, whose fluorescent state after apparent photobleaching can be restored at room temperature upon irradiation at shorter wavelengths. Ensemble photobleaching and recovery experiments of Cy5 in aqueous solution irradiating first at 633 nm, then at 337, 488, or 532 nm, demonstrate that restoration of absorption and fluorescence strongly depends on efficient oxygen removal and the addition of the triplet quencher beta-mercaptoethylamine. Single-molecule fluorescence experiments show that individual immobilized Cy5 molecules can be switched optically in milliseconds by applying alternating excitation at 633 and 488 nm between a fluorescent and nonfluorescent state up to 100 times with a reliability of >90\% at room temperature. Because of their intriguing performance, carbocyanine dyes volunteer as a simple alternative for ultrahigh-density optical data storage. Measurements on single donor/acceptor (tetramethylrhodamine/Cy5) labeled oligonucleotides point out that the described light-driven switching behavior imposes fundamental limitations on the use of carbocyanine dyes as energy transfer acceptors for the study of biological processes.},

abstract = {We report on a novel laser-induced fluorescence triple-integration method (LIFTIME) that is capable of making rapid, continuous fluorescence lifetime measurements by a unique photon-counting technique. The LIFTIME has been convolved with picosecond time-resolved laser-induced fluorescence, which employs a high-repetition-rate mode-locked laser, permitting the eventual monitoring of instantaneous species concentrations in turbulent flames. We verify the technique by application of the LIFTIME to two known fluorescence media, diphenyloxazole (PPO) and quinine sulfate monohydrate (QSM). PPO has a fluorescence lifetime of 1.28 ns, whereas QSM has a fluorescence lifetime that can be varied from 1.0 to 3.0 ns. From these liquid samples we demonstrate that fluorescence lifetime can currently be monitored at a sampling rate of up to 500 Hz with less than 10\% uncertainty (1 sigma) .},

abstract = {In living cells, biochemical reaction networks often function in nonequilibrium steady states. Under these conditions, the networks necessarily have cyclic reaction kinetics that are maintained by sustained constant input and output, i.e., pumping. To differentiate this state from an equilibrium state without flux, we propose a microscopic method based on concentration fluctuation measurements, via fluorescence correlation spectroscopy, and statistical analyses of high-order correlations and cross correlations beyond the standard fluorescence correlation spectroscopy autocorrelation. We show that, for equilibrium systems with time reversibility, the correlation functions possess certain symmetries, the violation of which is a measure of steady-state fluxes in reaction cycles. This result demonstrates the theoretical basis for experimentally measuring reaction fluxes in a biochemical network in situ and the importance of single-molecule measurements in providing fundamental information on nonequilibrium steady-states in biochemistry.},

The method includes a combinatorial approach to make the DNA constructs needed and automated real-time measurement of the kinetics using fluorescence. We validated the approach and investigated the flexibility of two kinds of nicked DNA and AT dinucleotide repeats. We found that, although the nicks hardly alter the bending flexibility, they significantly increase the torsional flexibility, and that the AT repeat has 28\% (+/-12\%) lower bending rigidity than a generic DNA sequence.},

abstract = {We present advances in the use of single-molecule FRET measurements with flexibly linked dyes to derive full 3D structures of DNA constructs based on absolute distances. The resolution obtained by this single-molecule approach harbours the potential to study in detail also protein- or damage-induced DNA bending. If one is to generate a geometric structural model, distances between fixed positions are needed. These are usually not experimentally accessible because of unknown fluorophore-linker mobility effects that lead to a distribution of FRET efficiencies and distances. To solve this problem, we performed studies on DNA double-helices by systematically varying donor acceptor distances from 2 to 10 nm. Analysis of dye-dye quenching and fluorescence anisotropy measurements reveal slow positional and fast orientational fluorophore dynamics, that results in an isotropic average of the FRET efficiency. We use a nonlinear conversion function based on MD simulations that allows us to include this effect in the calculation of absolute FRET distances. To obtain unique structures, we performed a quantitative statistical analysis for the conformational search in full space based on triangulation, which uses the known helical nucleic acid features. Our higher accuracy allowed the detection of sequence-dependent DNA bending by 16 degrees . For DNA with bulged adenosines, we also quantified the kink angles introduced by the insertion of 1, 3 and 5 bases to be 32 degrees +/- 6 degrees , 56 degrees +/- 4 degrees and 73 +/- 2 degrees , respectively. Moreover, the rotation angles and shifts of the helices were calculated to describe the relative orientation of the two arms in detail.},

abstract = {Certain G-rich DNA sequences readily form four-stranded structures called G-quadruplexes. These sequence motifs are located in telomeres as a repeated unit, and elsewhere in the genome, where their function is currently unknown. It has been proposed that G-quadruplexes may be directly involved in gene regulation at the level of transcription. In support of this hypothesis, we show that the promoter regions (1 kb upstream of the transcription start site TSS) of genes are significantly enriched in quadruplex motifs relative to the rest of the genome, with >40\% of human gene promoters containing one or more quadruplex motif. Furthermore, these promoter quadruplexes strongly associate with nuclease hypersensitive sites identified throughout the genome via biochemical measurement. Regions of the human genome that are both nuclease hypersensitive and within promoters show a remarkable (230-fold) enrichment of quadruplex elements, compared to the rest of the genome. These quadruplex motifs identified in promoter regions also show an interesting structural bias towards more stable forms. These observations support the proposal that promoter G-quadruplexes are directly involved in the regulation of gene expression.},

abstract = {Single molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer has been extensively used to measure distance changes and kinetics in various biomolecular systems. However, due to complications involving multiple de-excitation pathways of the dyes, the absolute inter-dye distance information has seldom been recovered. To circumvent this we directly probe the relative variations in the quantum yield of individual fluorophores. B-DNA was used as a scaffold to position the donor (Cy3 or TMR) at precise distances from the acceptor (Cy5) within the Forster radius. We found that the variation in the Cy3 quantum yield is approximately 5 times larger than that of TMR. By taking into account the molecule-to-molecule variability in the acceptor/donor quantum yield ratio, the apparent fluorescence resonance energy transfer efficiencies were scaled to yield the theoretical values. We obtained very good agreement with a physical model that predicts distances along B-DNA.},

abstract = {We inertially inject and study the contents of optically trappable aqueous nanodroplets (hydrosomes) emulsified in a perfluorinated matrix. A new piezoelectric actuated device for production of single hydrosomes on demand is introduced. Hydrosomes containing enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) were injected, optically trapped, and held at the focus of an excitation laser in a confocal microscope, and single-molecule photobleaching events were observed. The rotational diffusion time of EGFP in trapped hydrosomes was measured using time-resolved fluorescence anisotropy. In free solution, the mean rotational diffusion time was determined to be 13.8 +/- 0.1 ns at 3 microM and 14.0 +/- 0.2 ns at 10 microM. In hydrosomes, the mean rotational diffusion time was similar and determined to be 12.6 +/- 1.0 ns at 3 microM and 15.5 +/- 1.6 ns at 10 microM. We conclude that the rotational motion inside the nanodroplets is consistent with rotation in free solution and that the protein therefore does not aggregate at the water-oil interface. Protein can be confined in hydrosomes with high efficiency using this technique, which provides an alternative to surface attachment or lipid encapsulation and opens up new avenues of research using single molecules contained in fluid nanovolumes.},

abstract = {In this review, we give an overview of recent literature on the structure and stability of unimolecular G-rich quadruplex structures that are relevant to drug design and for in vivo function. The unifying theme in this review is energetics. The thermodynamic stability of quadruplexes has not been studied in the same detail as DNA and RNA duplexes, and there are important differences in the balance of forces between these classes of folded oligonucleotides. We provide an overview of the principles of stability and where available the experimental data that report on these principles. Significant gaps in the literature have been identified, that should be filled by a systematic study of well-defined quadruplexes not only to provide the basic understanding of stability both for design purposes, but also as it relates to in vivo occurrence of quadruplexes. Techniques that are commonly applied to the determination of the structure, stability and folding are discussed in terms of information content and limitations. Quadruplex structures fold and unfold comparatively slowly, and DNA unwinding events associated with transcription and replication may be operating far from equilibrium. The kinetics of formation and resolution of quadruplexes, and methodologies are discussed in the context of stability and their possible biological occurrence.},

ALEX (alternating-laser excitation) spectroscopy is a new method that extends single-molecule FRET by providing simultaneous information about structure and stoichiometry; this new information allows the detection of interactions in the absence of FRET and extends the dynamic range of distance measurements that are accessible through FRET. In the present article, we discuss combinations of ALEX with confocal microscopy for studying in-solution and in-gel molecules; we also discuss combining ALEX with TIRF (total internal reflection fluorescence) for studying surface-immobilized molecules. We also highlight applications of ALEX to the study of protein-nucleic acid interactions.},

abstract = {The sulfoindocyanine Cy3 is one of the most commonly used fluorescent dyes in the investigation of the structure and dynamics of nucleic acids by means of fluorescence methods. In this work, we report the fluorescence and photophysical properties of Cy3 attached covalently to single-stranded and duplex DNA. Steady-state and time-resolved fluorescence techniques were used to determine fluorescence quantum yields, emission lifetimes, and fluorescence anisotropy decays. The existence of a transient photoisomer was investigated by means of transient absorption techniques. The fluorescence quantum yield of Cy3 is highest when attached to the 5' terminus of single-stranded DNA (Cy3-5' ssDNA), and decreases by a factor of 2.4 when the complementary strand is annealed to form duplex DNA (Cy3-5' dsDNA). Substantial differences were also observed between the 5'-modified strands and strands modified through an internal amino-modified deoxy uridine. The fluorescence decay of Cy3 became multiexponential upon conjugation to DNA. The longest lifetime was observed for Cy3-5' ssDNA, where about 50\% of the decay is dominated by a 2.0-ns lifetime. This value is more than 10 times larger than the fluorescence lifetime of the free dye in solution. These observations are interpreted in terms of a model where the molecule undergoes a trans-cis isomerization reaction from the first excited state. We observed that the activation energy for photoisomerization depends strongly on the microenvironment in which the dye is located. The unusually high activation energy measured for Cy3-5' ssDNA is an indication of dye-ssDNA interactions. In fact, the time-resolved fluorescence anisotropy decay of this sample is dominated by a 2.5-ns rotational correlation time, which evidences the lack of rotational freedom of the dye around the linker that separates it from the terminal 5' phosphate. The remarkable variations in the photophysical properties of Cy3-DNA constructs demonstrate that caution should be used when Cy3 is used in studies employing DNA conjugates.},

abstract = {The predictions of counterion condensation theory for divalent ions were tested by comparison with the results of Monte Carlo calculations on an all-atom model of DNA. Monovalent-divalent competition at the polyelectrolyte surface was investigated by varying the partial molar volume of divalent ions. To assess the viability of using Poisson-Boltzmann (PB) calculations for determining divalent ion concentrations at DNA surfaces, Monte Carlo (MC) calculations were compared with PB calculations using different models of the dielectric continuum. It was determined that, while standard PB calculations of divalent ion surface densities are about 25-30\% below those predicted by MC techniques, and somewhat larger than errors previously determined for monovalent ions, errors due to the use of the mean-field approximation of PB theory are smaller than those arising from common assumptions regarding the dielectric continuum.},

abstract = {Temperature sensors are potentially susceptible to errors due to heating by solar radiation. Although this is well known for air temperature (Ta), significance to continuous water temperature (Tw) monitoring is relatively untested. This paper assesses radiative errors by comparing measurements of exposed and shielded Tinytag sensors under indirect and direct solar radiation, and in laboratory experiments under controlled, artificial light. In shallow, still-water and under direct solar radiation, measurement discrepancies between exposed and shielded sensors averaged 0.4 °C but can reach 1.6 °C. Around 0.3 °C of this inconsistency is explained by variance in measurement accuracy between sensors; the remainder is attributed to solar radiation. Discrepancies were found to increase with light intensity, but to attain Tw differences in excess of 0.5 °C requires direct, bright solar radiation (>400 W m−2 in the total spectrum). Under laboratory conditions, radiative errors are an order of magnitude lower when thermistors are placed in flowing water (even at velocities as low as 0.1 m s−1). Radiative errors were also modest relative to the discrepancy between different thermistor manufacturers. Based on these controlled experiments, a set of guidelines are recommended for deploying thermistor arrays in water bodies.},

abstract = {In Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) experiments, the donor (D) and acceptor (A) fluorophores are usually attached to the macromolecule of interest via long flexible linkers of up to 15 \AA in length. This causes significant uncertainties in quantitative distance measurements and prevents experiments with short distances between the attachment points of the dyes due to possible dye-dye interactions. We present two approaches to overcome the above problems as demonstrated by FRET measurements for a series of dsDNA and dsRNA internally labeled with Alexa488 and Cy5 as D and A dye, respectively. First, we characterize the influence of linker length and flexibility on FRET for different dye linker types (long, intermediate, short) by analyzing fluorescence lifetime and anisotropy decays. For long linkers, we describe a straightforward procedure that allows for very high accuracy of FRET-based structure determination through proper consideration of the position distribution of the dye and of linker dynamics. The position distribution can be quickly calculated with geometric accessible volume (AV) simulations, provided that the local structure of RNA or DNA in the proximity of the dye is known and that the dye diffuses freely in the sterically allowed space. The AV approach provides results similar to molecular dynamics simulations (MD) and is fully consistent with experimental FRET data. In a benchmark study for ds A-RNA, an rmsd value of 1.3 \AA is achieved. Considering the case of undefined dye environments or very short DA distances, we introduce short linkers with a propargyl or alkenyl unit for internal labeling of nucleic acids to minimize position uncertainties. Studies by ensemble time correlated single photon counting and single-molecule detection show that the nature of the linker strongly affects the radius of the dye's accessible volume (6-16 \AA). For short propargyl linkers, heterogeneous dye environments are observed on the millisecond time scale. A detailed analysis of possible orientation effects ($\kappa$(2) problem) indicates that, for short linkers and unknown local environments, additional $\kappa$(2)-related uncertainties are clearly outweighed by better defined dye positions.},

@article{Lamboy2013,
abstract = {Previous single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (smFRET) studies in which the second and sixth ankyrin repeats (ARs) of I$\kappa$B$\alpha$ were labeled with FRET pairs showed slow fluctuations as if the I$\kappa$B$\alpha$ AR domain was unfolding in its native state. To systematically probe where these slow dynamic fluctuations occur, we now present data from smFRET studies wherein FRET labels were placed at ARs 1 and 4 (mutant named AR 1-4), at ARs 2 and 5 (AR 2-5), and at ARs 3 and 6 (AR 3-6). The results presented here reveal that AR 6 most readily detaches/unfolds from the AR domain, undergoing substantial fluctuations at room temperature. AR 6 has fewer stabilizing consensus residues than the other I$\kappa$B$\alpha$ ARs, probably contributing to the ease with which AR 6 "loses grip". AR 5 shows almost no fluctuations at room temperature, but a significant fraction of molecules shows fluctuations at 37C. Introduction of stabilizing mutations that are known to fold AR 6 dampen the fluctuations of AR 5, indicating that the AR 5 fluctuations are likely due to weakened inter-repeat stabilization from AR 6. AR 1 also fluctuates somewhat at room temperature, suggesting that fluctuations are a general behavior of ARs at ends of AR domains. Remarkably, AR 1 still fluctuates in the bound state, but mainly between 0.6 and 0.9 FRET efficiency, whereas in the free I$\kappa$B$\alpha$, the fluctuations extend to <0.5 FRET efficiency. Overall, our results provide a more complete picture of the energy landscape of the native state dynamics of an AR domain.},

abstract = {Interactions governing protein folding, stability, recognition, and activity are mediated by hydration. Here, we use small-angle neutron scattering coupled with osmotic stress to investigate the hydration of two proteins, lysozyme and guanylate kinase (GK), in the presence of solutes. By taking advantage of the neutron contrast variation that occurs upon addition of these solutes, the number of protein-associated (solute-excluded) water molecules can be estimated from changes in both the zero-angle scattering intensity and the radius of gyration. Poly(ethylene glycol) exclusion varies with molecular weight. This sensitivity can be exploited to probe structural features such as the large internal GK cavity. For GK, small-angle neutron scattering is complemented by isothermal titration calorimetry with osmotic stress to also measure hydration changes accompanying ligand binding. These results provide a framework for studying other biomolecular systems and assemblies using neutron scattering together with osmotic stress.},

abstract = {We have investigated the structure and unfolding kinetics of the human telomeric intramolecular G quadruplex by using single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer. An exploration of conformational heterogeneity revealed two stable folded conformations, in both sodium- and potassium-containing buffers, with small differences between their enthalpies and entropies. Both folded conformations can be opened by the addition of a 21-base complementary DNA oligonucleotide. The unfolding of both substates occurs at the same rate, which showed dependence on the monovalent metal cation present. Temperature-dependence studies in 100 mM KCl gave an apparent activation enthalpy and entropy of 6.4 +/- 0.4 kcal.mol-1 and -52.3 +/- 1.4 cal.mol-1.K-1, respectively, indicating that the unfolding is entropically driven and can occur easily. In contrast, in 100 mM NaCl the respective values are 14.9 +/- 0.2 kcal.mol-1 and -23.0 +/- 0.8 cal.mol-1.K-1, suggesting a more significant enthalpic barrier. Molecular modeling suggests that the two species are likely to be the parallel and antiparallel quadruplex structures. The unfolding free energy barrier is estimated to be between 3 and 15 kBT based on Kramers' theory. We conclude that under near-physiological conditions these structures coexist and can interconvert on a minute time scale.},

abstract = {In aqueous environments, acidity is arguably the most important property dictating the chemical, physical, and biological processes that can occur. However, in a variety of environments where the minuscule size limits the number of water molecules, the conventional macroscopic description of pH is no longer valid. This situation arises for any and all nanoscopically confined water including cavities in minerals, porous solids, zeolites, atmospheric aerosols, enzyme active sites, membrane channels, and biological cells and organelles. To understand pH in these confined spaces, we have explored reverse micelles as a model system that confines water to nanoscale droplets. At the appropriate concentrations, reverse micelles form in ternary or higher order solutions of nonpolar solvent, polar solvent (usually water), and amphipathic molecules, usually surfactants or lipids. Measuring the acidity, or local density of protons, commonly known as pH, of these nanoscopic water pools in reverse micelles is challenging. First, because the volume of the water in these reverse micelles is so minute, we cannot probe its proton concentration using traditional pH meters. Second, the traditional concept of pH breaks down in a nanosystem that includes fewer than 10(7) water molecules. Third, the interpretation of results from studies attempting to measure acidity or pH in these environments is nontrivial because the conditions fall outside the accepted IUPAC definition for pH. Researchers have developed experimental methods to measure acidity indirectly using various spectroscopic probe molecules. Most measurements of intramicellar pH have employed optical spectroscopy of organic probe molecules containing at least one labile proton coupled to electronic transitions to track pH changes in the environment. These indirect measurements of the pH reflect the local environment sensed by the probe and are complicated by the probe location within the sample and how that location affects properties such as pK(a). Thus, interpretation of the measurement in the highly heterogeneous reverse micellar environment can be challenging. Organic pH probes can often produce ambiguous acidity measurements, because the probes can readily associate with or penetrate the micellar interface. Protonation can also dramatically change the polarity of the probe and shift the probe's location within the system. As a result, researchers have developed highly charged pH-sensitive probes such as hydroxypyrene trisulfonate, vanadate or phosphate that reside in the water pool both before and after protonation. For inorganic probes researchers have used multinuclear NMR spectroscopy to directly measure conditions in the water droplet. Regardless of the probe and method employed, reverse micellar studies include many implicit assumptions. All reported pH measurements comprise averages of molecular ensembles rather than the response of a single molecule. Experiments also represent averages of the dynamic reverse micelles over the time of the experiments. Thus the experiments report results from an average molecular position, pK(a), ionic strength, viscosity, etc. Although the exact meaning of pH in nanosized waterpools challenges scientific intuition and experimental data are non-trivial to interpret, continued experimental studies are critical to improve understanding of these nanoscopic water pools. Experimental data will allow theorists the tools to develop the models that further explore the meaning of pH in nanosized environments.},

abstract = {Microscopy-based fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) experiments measure donor and acceptor intensities by isolating these signals with a series of optical elements. Because this filtering discards portions of the spectrum, the observed FRET efficiency is dependent on the set of filters in use. Similarly, observed FRET efficiency is also affected by differences in fluorophore quantum yield. Recovering the absolute FRET efficiency requires normalization for these effects to account for differences between the donor and acceptor fluorophores in their quantum yield and detection efficiency. Without this correction, FRET is consistent across multiple experiments only if the photophysical and instrument properties remain unchanged. Here we present what is, to our knowledge, the first systematic study of methods to recover the true FRET efficiency using DNA rulers with known fluorophore separations. We varied optical elements to purposefully alter observed FRET and examined protein samples to achieve quantum yields distinct from those in the DNA samples. Correction for calculated instrument transmission reduced FRET deviations, which can facilitate comparison of results from different instruments. Empirical normalization was more effective but required significant effort. Normalization based on single-molecule photobleaching was the most effective depending on how it is applied. Surprisingly, per-molecule gamma-normalization reduced the peak width in the DNA FRET distribution because anomalous gamma-values correspond to FRET outliers. Thus, molecule-to-molecule variation in gamma has an unrecognized effect on the FRET distribution that must be considered to extract information on sample dynamics from the distribution width.},

abstract = {Cyanine fluorophores are commonly used in single-molecule FRET experiments with nucleic acids. We have previously shown that indocarbocyanine fluorophores attached to the 5'-termini of DNA and RNA via three-carbon atom linkers stack on the ends of the helix, orienting their transition moments. We now investigate the orientation of sulfoindocarbocyanine fluorophores tethered to the 5'-termini of DNA via 13-atom linkers. Fluorescence lifetime measurements of sulfoindocarbocyanine 3 attached to double-stranded DNA indicate that the fluorophore is extensively stacked onto the terminal basepair at 15 °C, with properties that depend on the terminal sequence. In single molecules of duplex DNA, FRET efficiency between sulfoindocarbocyanine 3 and 5 attached in this manner is modulated with helix length, indicative of fluorophore orientation and consistent with stacked fluorophores that can undergo lateral motion. We conclude that terminal stacking is an intrinsic property of the cyanine fluorophores irrespective of the length of the tether and the presence or absence of sulfonyl groups. However, compared to short-tether indocarbocyanine, the mean rotational relationship between the two fluorophores is changed by ∼60° for the long-tether sulfoindocarbocyanine fluorophores. This is consistent with the transition moments becoming approximately aligned with the long axis of the terminal basepair for the long-linker species.},

abstract = {Recent years have seen a number of investigations in which distances within unfolded proteins, polypeptides, and other biopolymers are probed via fluorescence resonance energy transfer, a method that relies on the strong distance dependence of energy transfer between a pair of dyes attached to the molecule of interest. In order to interpret the results of such experiments it is commonly assumed that intramolecular diffusion is negligible during the excited state lifetime. Here we explore the conditions under which this "frozen chain" approximation fails, leading to significantly underestimated donor-acceptor distances, and describe a means of correcting for polymer dynamics in order to estimate these distances more accurately.},

By comparing the shapes of covalently closed, nicked and gapped DNA minicircles, we conclude that 94-bp-long covalently closed and nicked DNA minicircles do not show sharp kinks while gapped DNA molecules, containing very flexible single-stranded regions, do show sharp kinks. We corroborate the results of cryo-EM studies by using Bal31 nuclease to probe for the existence of kinks in 94-bp-long minicircles.},

abstract = {The three-dimensional solution structure of a DNA molecule of the sequence 5'-d(GCATCGAAAAAGCTACG)-3' paired with 5'-d(CGTAGCCGATGC)-3' containing a five-adenine bulge loop (dA(5)-bulge) between two double helical stems was determined by 2D (1)H and (31)P NMR, infrared, and Raman spectroscopy. The DNA in both stems adopt a classical B-form double helical structure with Watson-Crick base pairing and C2'-endo sugar conformation. In addition, the two dG/dC base pairs framing the dA(5)-bulge loop are formed and are stable at least up to 30 degrees C. The five adenine bases of the bulge loop are localized at intrahelical positions within the double helical stems. Stacking on the double helical stem is continued for the first four 5'-adenines in the bulge loop. The total rise (the height) of these four stacked adenines roughly equals the diameter of the double helical stem. The stacking interactions are broken between the last of these four 5'-adenines and the fifth loop adenine at the 3'-end. This 3'-adenine partially stacks on the other stem. The angle between the base planes of the two nonstacking adenines (A10 and A11) in the bulge loop reflects the kinking angle of the global DNA structure. The neighboring cytosines opposite the dA(5)-bulge (being parts of the bulge flanking base pairs) do not stack on one another. This disruption of stacking is characterized by a partial shearing of these bases, such that certain sequential NOEs for this base step are preserved. In the base step opposite the loop, an extraordinary hydrogen bond is observed between the phosphate backbone of the 5'-dC and the amino proton of the 3'-dC in about two-thirds of the conformers. This hydrogen bond probably contributes to stabilizing the global DNA structure. The dA(5)-bulge induces a local kink into the DNA molecule of about 73 degrees (+/-11 degrees ). This kinking angle and the mutual orientation of the two double helical stems agree well with results from fluorescence resonance energy transfer measurements of single- and double-bulge DNA molecules.},

abstract = {Telomeric ends of chromosomes, which comprise noncoding repeat sequences of guanine-rich DNA, are fundamental in protecting the cell from recombination and degradation. Disruption of telomere maintenance leads to eventual cell death, which can be exploited for therapeutic intervention in cancer. Telomeric DNA sequences can form four-stranded (quadruplex) structures, which may be involved in the structure of telomere ends. Here we describe the crystal structure of a quadruplex formed from four consecutive human telomeric DNA repeats and grown at a K(+) concentration that approximates its intracellular concentration. K(+) ions are observed in the structure. The folding and appearance of the DNA in this intramolecular quadruplex is fundamentally different from the published Na(+)-containing quadruplex structures. All four DNA strands are parallel, with the three linking trinucleotide loops positioned on the exterior of the quadruplex core, in a propeller-like arrangement. The adenine in each TTA linking trinucleotide loop is swung back so that it intercalates between the two thymines. This DNA structure suggests a straightforward path for telomere folding and unfolding, as well as ways in which it can recognize telomere-associated proteins.},

abstract = {Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) is a sensitive and widely used technique for measuring diffusion. FCS data are conventionally modeled with a finite number of diffusing components and fit with a least-square fitting algorithm. This approach is inadequate for analyzing data obtained from highly heterogeneous systems. We introduce a Maximum Entropy Method based fitting routine (MEMFCS) that analyzes FCS data in terms of a quasicontinuous distribution of diffusing components, and also guarantees a maximally wide distribution that is consistent with the data. We verify that for a homogeneous specimen (green fluorescent protein in dilute aqueous solution), both MEMFCS and conventional fitting yield similar results. Further, we incorporate an appropriate goodness of fit criterion in MEMFCS. We show that for errors estimated from a large number of repeated measurements, the reduced chi(2) value in MEMFCS analysis does approach unity. We find that the theoretical prediction for errors in FCS experiments overestimates the actual error, but can be empirically modified to serve as a guide for estimating the goodness of the fit where reliable error estimates are unavailable. Finally, we compare the performance of MEMFCS with that of a conventional fitting routine for analyzing simulated data describing a highly heterogeneous distribution containing 41 diffusing species. Both methods fit the data well. However, the conventional fit fails to reproduce the essential features of the input distribution, whereas MEMFCS yields a distribution close to the actual input.},

abstract = {Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) can provide a wealth of information about biological and chemical systems on a broad range of time scales (<1 micros to >1 s). Numerical modeling of the FCS observation volume combined with measurements has revealed, however, that the standard assumption of a three-dimensional Gaussian FCS observation volume is not a valid approximation under many common measurement conditions. As a result, the FCS autocorrelation will contain significant, systematic artifacts that are most severe with confocal optics when using a large detector aperture and aperture-limited illumination. These optical artifacts manifest themselves in the fluorescence correlation as an apparent additional exponential component or diffusing species with significant (>30\%) amplitude that can imply extraneous kinetics, shift the measured diffusion time by as much as approximately 80\%, and cause the axial ratio to diverge. Artifacts can be minimized or virtually eliminated by using a small confocal detector aperture, underfilled objective back-aperture, or two-photon excitation. However, using a detector aperture that is smaller or larger than the optimal value (approximately 4.5 optical units) greatly reduces both the count rate per molecule and the signal-to-noise ratio. Thus, there is a tradeoff between optimizing signal-to-noise and reducing experimental artifacts in one-photon FCS.},

abstract = {Single molecule spectroscopy experiments and molecular dynamics simulations have several profound features in common, chief among which is that both follow the dynamics of some degrees of freedom of a single molecule over time. The analysis is essentially the same: one investigates the changes in the degrees of freedom followed. For instance, in a single molecule fluorescence experiment, the degree of freedom is often the number of photons detected in some time period. In this article, we introduce a straightforward Bayesian method for detecting if and when changes occurred. In contrast to methods based upon maximum likelihood estimates, a Bayesian approach allows for a more systematic means not only to change point detection but also to cluster the data into states. Most importantly, the Bayesian method supplies a simpler hypothesis testing framework. Although we focus on Poisson-distributed data, the Bayesian methods outlined here can in principle be applied to data sampled from any distribution.},

@article{Yoffe2008,
abstract = {We present a theory of the dependence on sequence of the three-dimensional size of large single-stranded (ss) RNA molecules. The work is motivated by the fact that the genomes of many viruses are large ssRNA molecules-often several thousand nucleotides long-and that these RNAs are spontaneously packaged into small rigid protein shells. We argue that there has been evolutionary pressure for the genome to have overall spatial properties-including an appropriate radius of gyration, R(g)-that facilitate this assembly process. For an arbitrary RNA sequence, we introduce the (thermal) average maximum ladder distance (MLD) and use it as a measure of the "extendedness" of the RNA secondary structure. The MLD values of viral ssRNAs that package into capsids of fixed size are shown to be consistently smaller than those for randomly permuted sequences of the same length and base composition, and also smaller than those of natural ssRNAs that are not under evolutionary pressure to have a compact native form. By mapping these secondary structures onto a linear polymer model and by using MLD as a measure of effective contour length, we predict the R(g) values of viral ssRNAs are smaller than those of nonviral sequences. More generally, we predict the average MLD values of large nonviral ssRNAs scale as N(0.67+/-0.01), where N is the number of nucleotides, and that their R(g) values vary as MLD(0.5) in an ideal solvent, and hence as N(0.34). An alternative analysis, which explicitly includes all branches, is introduced and shown to yield consistent results.},

abstract = {Although widely accepted that high-throughput biological data are typically highly noisy, the effects that this uncertainty has upon the conclusions we draw from these data are often overlooked. However, in order to assign any degree of confidence to our conclusions, we must quantify these effects. Bootstrap resampling is one method by which this may be achieved. Here, we present a parametric bootstrapping approach for time-course data, in which Gaussian process regression (GPR) is used to fit a probabilistic model from which replicates may then be drawn. This approach implicitly allows the time dependence of the data to be taken into account, and is applicable to a wide range of problems.},

abstract = {Dynamic RNA molecules carry out essential processes in the cell including translation and splicing. Base-pair interactions stabilize RNA into relatively rigid structures, while flexible non-base-paired regions allow RNA to undergo conformational changes required for function. To advance our understanding of RNA folding and dynamics it is critical to know the flexibility of these un-base-paired regions and how it depends on counterions. Yet, information about nucleic acid polymer properties is mainly derived from studies of ssDNA. Here we measure the persistence lengths (l(p)) of ssRNA. We observe valence and ionic strength-dependent differences in l(p) in a direct comparison between 40-mers of deoxythymidylate (dT(40)) and uridylate (rU(40)) measured using the powerful combination of SAXS and smFRET. We also show that nucleic acid flexibility is influenced by local environment (an adjoining double helix). Our results illustrate the complex interplay between conformation and ion environment that modulates nucleic acid function in vivo.},

abstract = {Kissing hairpin interactions form when the loop residues of two hairpins have Watson-Crick complementarity. In a unimolecular context, kissing interactions are important for tertiary folding and pseudoknot formation, whereas in a bimolecular context, they provide a basis for molecular recognition. In some cases, kissing complexes can be a prelude to strand displacement reactions where the two hairpins resolve to form a stable extended intermolecular duplex. The kinetics and thermodynamics of kissing-complex formation and their subsequent strand-displacement reactions are poorly understood. Here, biophysical techniques including isothermal titration calorimetry, surface plasmon resonance, and single-molecule fluorescence have been employed to probe the factors that govern the stability of kissing complexes and their subsequent structural rearrangements. We show that the general understanding of RNA duplex formation can be extended to kissing complexes but that kissing complexes display an unusual level of stability relative to simple duplexes of the same sequence. These interactions form and break many times at room temperature before becoming committed to a slow, irreversible forward transition to the strand-displaced form. Furthermore, using smFRET we show that the primary difference between stable and labile kissing complexes is based almost completely on their off rates. Both stable and labile complexes form at the same rate within error, but less stable species dissociate rapidly, allowing us to understand how these complexes can help generate specificity along a folding pathway or during a gene regulation event.},

Phys. 2002, 117, 10965) to obtain distance correlation functions from photon arrival trajectories of single fluorophores whose lifetime, [k(r)](-1), depends on the distance to a quencher. It is assumed that this distance does not change during the fluorescence lifetime. The experimental trajectory is first transformed by replacing the delay time (i.e., the interval between the photon arrival and the nearest laser pulse) by a certain function of this delay time. This function is the inverse Laplace transform of r(k), which is the solution of k(r) = 1. The correlation function of the transformed data then directly gives the distance correlation function. Illustrative examples include F\"{o}rster energy transfer and quenching due to electron transfer.},

abstract = {Single-molecule measurements of biomolecules can provide information about the molecular interactions and kinetics that are hidden in ensemble measurements. However, there is a requirement for techniques with improved sensitivity and time resolution for use in exploring biomolecular systems with fast dynamics. Here, we report the detection of DNA hybridization at the single-molecule level using a carbon nanotube field-effect transistor. By covalently attaching a single-stranded probe DNA sequence to a point defect in a carbon nanotube, we are able to measure two-level fluctuations in the conductance of the nanotube in the presence of a complementary DNA target. The kinetics of the system are studied as a function of temperature, allowing the measurement of rate constants, melting curves and activation energies for different sequences and target concentrations. The kinetics demonstrate non-Arrhenius behaviour, in agreement with DNA hybridization experiments using fluorescence correlation spectroscopy. This technique is label-free and could be used to probe single-molecule dynamics at microsecond timescales.},

abstract = {Electrophoresis is widely used to determine the electrostatic potential of colloidal particles. Oil droplets in pure water show negative or positive electrophoretic mobilities depending on the pH. This is commonly attributed to the adsorption of hydroxyl or hydronium ions, resulting in a negative or positive surface charge, respectively. This explanation, however, is not in agreement with the difference in isoelectric point and point of zero charge observed in experiment. Here we present molecular dynamics simulations of oil droplets in water in the presence of an external electric field but in the absence of any ions. The simulations reproduce the negative sign and the order of magnitude of the oil droplet mobilities at the point of zero charge in experiment. The electrostatic potential in the oil with respect to the water phase, induced by anisotropic dipole orientation in the interface, is positive. Our results suggest that electrophoretic mobility does not always reflect the net charge or electrostatic potential of a suspended liquid droplet and, thus, the interpretation of electrophoresis in terms of purely continuum effects may need to be reevaluated.},

abstract = {We have studied the hydrophobic water/octadecyltrichlorosilane (OTS) interface by using the phase-sensitive sum-frequency vibrational spectroscopy (PS-SFVS), and we obtained detailed structural information of the interface at the molecular level. Excess ions emerging at the interface were detected by changes of the surface vibrational spectrum induced by the surface field created by the excess ions. Both hydronium (H(3)O(+)) and hydroxide (OH(-)) ions were found to adsorb at the interface, and so did other negative ions such as Cl(-). By varying the ion concentrations in the bulk water, their adsorption isotherms were measured. It was seen that among the three, OH(-) has the highest adsorption energy, and H(3)O(+) has the lowest; OH(-) also has the highest saturation coverage, and Cl(-) has the lowest. The result shows that even the neat water/OTS interface is not neutral, but charged with OH(-) ions. The result also explains the surprising observation that the isoelectric point appeared at approximately 3.0 when HCl was used to decrease the pH starting from neat water.},

There is one universal aspect of the cellular interior, however, that is largely neglected--the fact that it is highly crowded with macromolecules. It is proposed that the addition of crowding agents should become as routine as controlling pH and ionic strength if we are to meet the objective of studying biological molecules under more physiologically relevant conditions.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Repeats of Gn sequences are detected as single strand overhangs at the ends of eukaryotic chromosomes together with associated binding proteins. Such telomere sequences have been implicated in the replication and maintenance of chromosomal termini. They may also mediate chromosomal organization and association during meiosis and mitosis. RESULTS: We have determined the three-dimensional solution structure of the human telomere sequence, d[AG3(T2AG3)3] in Na(+)-containing solution using a combined NMR, distance geometry and molecular dynamics approach (including relaxation matrix refinement). The sequence, which contains four AG3 repeats, folds intramolecularly into a G-tetraplex stabilized by three stacked G-tetrads which are connected by two lateral loops and a central diagonal loop. Of the four grooves that are formed, one is wide, two are of medium width and one is narrow. The alignment of adjacent G-G-G segments in parallel generates the two grooves of medium width whilst the antiparallel arrangement results in one wide and one narrow groove. Three of the four adenines stack on top of adjacent G-tetrads while the majority of the thymines sample multiple conformations. CONCLUSIONS: The availability of the d[AG3(T2AG3)3] solution structure containing four AG3 human telomeric repeats should permit the rational design of ligands that recognize and bind with specificity and affinity to the individual grooves of the G-tetraplex, as well as to either end containing the diagonal and lateral loops. Such ligands could modulate the equilibrium between folded G-tetraplex structures and their unfolded extended counterparts.},

@article{Tomov2012,
abstract = {Among the advantages of the single-molecule approach when used to study biomolecular structural dynamics and interaction is its ability to distinguish between and independently observe minor subpopulations. In a single-molecule F\"{o}rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) and alternating laser excitation diffusion experiment, the various populations are apparent in the resultant histograms. However, because histograms are calculated based on the per-burst mean FRET and stoichiometry ratio and not on the internal photon distribution, much of the acquired information is lost, thereby reducing the capabilities of the method. Here we suggest what to our knowledge is a novel statistical analysis tool that significantly enhances these capabilities, and we use it to identify and isolate static and dynamic subpopulations. Based on a kernel density estimator and a proper photon distribution analysis, for each individual burst, we calculate scores that reflect properties of interest. Specifically, we determine the FRET efficiency and brightness ratio distributions and use them to reveal 1), the underlying structure of a two-state DNA-hairpin and a DNA hairpin that is bound to DNA origami; 2), a minor doubly labeled dsDNA subpopulation concealed in a larger singly labeled dsDNA; and 3), functioning DNA origami motors concealed within a larger subpopulation of defective motors. Altogether, these findings demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed approach. The method was developed and tested using simulations, its rationality is described, and a computer algorithm is provided.},

abstract = {We describe a simple approach and present a straightforward numerical algorithm to compute the best fit shot-noise limited proximity ratio histogram (PRH) in single-molecule fluorescence resonant energy transfer diffusion experiments. The key ingredient is the use of the experimental burst size distribution, as obtained after burst search through the photon data streams. We show how the use of an alternated laser excitation scheme and a correspondingly optimized burst search algorithm eliminates several potential artifacts affecting the calculation of the best fit shot-noise limited PRH. This algorithm is tested extensively on simulations and simple experimental systems. We find that dsDNA data exhibit a wider PRH than expected from shot noise only and hypothetically account for it by assuming a small Gaussian distribution of distances with an average standard deviation of 1.6 A. Finally, we briefly mention the results of a future publication and illustrate them with a simple two-state model system (DNA hairpin), for which the kinetic transition rates between the open and closed conformations are extracted.},

abstract = {Single-stranded DNA overhangs at the ends of human telomeric repeats are capable of adopting four-stranded G-quadruplex structures, which could serve as potential anticancer targets. Out of the five reported intramolecular human telomeric G-quadruplex structures, four were formed in the presence of K(+) ions and only one in the presence of Na(+) ions, leading often to a perception that this structural polymorphism occurs exclusively in the presence of K(+) but not Na(+). Here we present the structure of a new antiparallel (2+2) G-quadruplex formed by a derivative of a 27-nt human telomeric sequence in Na(+) solution, which comprises a novel core arrangement distinct from the known topologies. This structure complements the previously elucidated basket-type human telomeric G-quadruplex to serve as reference structures in Na(+)-containing environment. These structures, together with the coexistence of other conformations in Na(+) solution as observed by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, establish the polymorphic nature of human telomeric repeats beyond the influence of K(+) ions.},

abstract = {Fluorescence resonance energy transfer, FRET, can be used to obtain long-range distance information for macromolecules and is particularly powerful when used in single-molecule studies. The determination of accurate distances requires knowledge of the fluorophore position with respect to the macromolecule. In this study we have used NMR to determine the structure of the commonly used fluorophore indocarbocyanine-5 (Cy5) covalently attached to the 5'-terminus of double-helical DNA. We find that Cy5 is predominantly stacked onto the end of the duplex, in a manner similar to an additional base pair. This is very similar to the behavior of Cy3 terminally attached to DNA and suggests that the efficiency of energy transfer between Cy3 and Cy5, that are attached to nucleic acids in this way, will exhibit significant dependence on fluorophore orientation.},

abstract = {We established the charge and structure of the oil/water interface by combining $\zeta$-potential measurements, sum frequency scattering (SFS) and molecular dynamics simulations. The SFS experiments show that the orientation of water molecules can be followed on the oil droplet/water interface. The average water orientation on a neat oil droplet/water interface is the same as the water orientation on a negatively charged interface. pH dependent experiments show, however, that there is no sign of selective adsorption of hydroxide ions. Molecular dynamics simulations, both with and without intermolecular charge transfer, show that the balance of accepting and donating hydrogen bonds is broken in the interfacial layer, leading to surface charging. This can account for the negative surface charge that is found in experiments.},

abstract = {A living cell generally contains macromolecules occupying 20-40\% of the total volume. To mimic the crowded cellular condition, we prepared solutions including poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) as a cosolute and investigated the influence of the cosolute on the DNA duplex stability. In the presence of PEG 200 or PEG 8000, the Tm (melting temperature) of a self-complementary duplex of 5'-dATGCGCAT-3' decreased by 11.8 degrees C in the presence of 20 wt\% PEG200 and by 1.5 degrees C in the presence of 20 wt\% PEG 8000. The dln K(obs) vs. dln a(w) plots for PEG 200 and PEG 8000 were linear with a negative slope, suggesting the association of water molecules upon the duplex formation. Interestingly, when the NaCl concentration decreased from 1 M to 400 mM, the Tm increased in the presence of PEGs. Our results imply that the nucleic acid stabilities in a living cell may be different from those in in vitro conditions.},

abstract = {DNA bending in 86 complexes with sequence-specific proteins has been examined using normal vector plots, matrices of normal vector angles between all base pairs in the helix, and one-digit roll/slide/twist tables. FREEHELIX, a new program especially designed to analyze severely bent and kinked duplexes, generates the foregoing quantities plus local roll, tilt, twist, slide, shift and rise parameters that are completely free of any assumptions about an overall helix axis. In nearly every case, bending results from positive roll at pyrimidine-purine base pair steps: C-A (= T-G), T-A, or less frequently C-G, in a direction that compresses the major groove. Normal vector plots reveal three well-defined types of bending among the 86 examples: (i) localized kinks produced by positive roll at one or two discrete base pairs steps, (ii) three-dimensional writhe resulting from positive roll at a series of adjacent base pairs steps, or (iii) continuous curvature produced by alternations of positive and negative roll every 5 bp, with side-to-side zig-zag roll at intermediate position. In no case is tilt a significant component of the bending process. In sequences with two localized kinks, such as CAP and IHF, the dihedral angle formed by the three helix segments is a linear function of the number of base pair steps between kinks: dihedral angle = 36 degrees x kink separation. Twenty-eight of the 86 examples can be described as major bends, and significant elements in the recognition of a given base sequence by protein. But even the minor bends play a role in fine-tuning protein/DNA interactions. Sequence-dependent helix deformability is an important component of protein/DNA recognition, alongside the more generally recognized patterns of hydrogen bonding. The combination of FREEHELIX, normal vector plots, full vector angle matrices, and one-digit roll/slide/twist tables affords a rapid and convenient method for assessing bending in DNA.},

abstract = {Understanding biological networks requires identifying their elementary protein interactions and establishing the timing and strength of those interactions. Fluorescence microscopy and F\"{o}rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) have the potential to reveal such information because they allow molecular interactions to be monitored in living cells, but it is unclear how best to analyze FRET data. Existing techniques differ in assumptions, manipulations of data and the quantities they derive. To address this variation, we have developed a versatile Bayesian analysis based on clear assumptions and systematic statistics.},

abstract = {Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) has proven to be a powerful technique with single-molecule sensitivity. Recently, it has found a complement in the form of fluorescence intensity distribution analysis (FIDA). Here we introduce a fluorescence fluctuation method that combines the features of both techniques. It is based on the global analysis of a set of photon count number histograms, recorded with multiple widths of counting time intervals simultaneously. This fluorescence intensity multiple distributions analysis (FIMDA) distinguishes fluorescent species on the basis of both the specific molecular brightness and the translational diffusion time. The combined information, extracted from a single measurement, increases the readout effectively by one dimension and thus breaks the individual limits of FCS and FIDA. In this paper a theory is introduced that describes the dependence of photon count number distributions on diffusion coefficients. The theory is applied to a series of photon count number histograms corresponding to different widths of counting time intervals. Although the ability of the method to determine specific brightness values, diffusion times, and concentrations from mixtures is demonstrated on simulated data, its experimental utilization is shown by the determination of the binding constant of a protein-ligand interaction exemplifying its broad applicability in the life sciences.},

abstract = {Single-molecule methods have made it possible to apply force to an individual RNA molecule. Two beads are attached to the RNA; one is on a micropipette, the other is in a laser trap. The force on the RNA and the distance between the beads are measured. Force can change the equilibrium and the rate of any reaction in which the product has a different extension from the reactant. This review describes use of laser tweezers to measure thermodynamics and kinetics of unfolding/refolding RNA. For a reversible reaction the work directly provides the free energy; for irreversible reactions the free energy is obtained from the distribution of work values. The rate constants for the folding and unfolding reactions can be measured by several methods. The effect of pulling rate on the distribution of force-unfolding values leads to rate constants for unfolding. Hopping of the RNA between folded and unfolded states at constant force provides both unfolding and folding rates. Force-jumps and force-drops, similar to the temperature jump method, provide direct measurement of reaction rates over a wide range of forces. The advantages of applying force and using single-molecule methods are discussed. These methods, for example, allow reactions to be studied in non-denaturing solvents at physiological temperatures; they also simplify analysis of kinetic mechanisms because only one intermediate at a time is present. Unfolding of RNA in biological cells by helicases, or ribosomes, has similarities to unfolding by force.},

abstract = {By monitoring fluorescently labeled lactose permease with single-molecule sensitivity, we investigated the molecular mechanism of how an Escherichia coli cell with the lac operon switches from one phenotype to another. At intermediate inducer concentrations, a population of genetically identical cells exhibits two phenotypes: induced cells with highly fluorescent membranes and uninduced cells with a small number of membrane-bound permeases. We found that this basal-level expression results from partial dissociation of the tetrameric lactose repressor from one of its operators on looped DNA. In contrast, infrequent events of complete dissociation of the repressor from DNA result in large bursts of permease expression that trigger induction of the lac operon. Hence, a stochastic single-molecule event determines a cell's phenotype. },

In a highly diluted aqueous solution of 20-mer oligonucleotide strand of DNA duplex labeled with the environment-sensitive fluorescent dye tetramethylrhodamine (TMR), fluorescence bursts indicating traces of individual molecules are registered and further subjected to selective burst analysis. The two-dimensional BIFL data allow the identification and detection of different temporally resolved conformational states. A complementary autocorrelation analysis was performed on the time-dependent fluctuations in fluorescence lifetime and intensity. The consistent results strongly support the hypothesized three-state model of the conformational dynamics of the TMR-DNA duplex with a polar, a nonpolar, and a quenching environment of TMR.},

abstract = {Quantitative fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) and fluorescence photobleaching recovery (FPR) measurements in bulk solution require a well characterized confocal laser microscope optical system. The introduction of a characteristic function, the collection efficiency function (CEF), provides a quantitative theoretical analysis of this system, which yields an interpretation of the FCS and FPR measurements in three dimensions. We demonstrate that when the proper field diaphragm is introduced, the 3-D FCS measurements can be mimicked by a 2-D theory with only minor error. The FPR characteristic recovery time for diffusion is expected to be slightly longer than the corresponding time measured by FCS in the same conditions. This is because the profile of the laser beam used for photobleaching is not affected by the field diaphragm. The CEF is also important for quantitative analysis of standard scanning confocal microscopy when it is carried out using a finite detection pinhole.},

The assumption that distances between luminophores attached to chain ends are not correlated with the relative orientations of luminophores is tested by theoretical calculations for the unperturbed chains Tyr-(Ala)(n)-Tyr with n equal to 4 and 9. It appears that for these chains, in which the conformation is dominated by entropic factors, the above assumption is satisfactory even for chains with a small number of repeating units (n = 4).},

@article{Benham2005,
abstract = {We review the history of DNA mechanics and its analysis. We evaluate several methods to analyze the structures of superhelical DNA molecules, each predicated on the assumption that DNA can be modeled with reasonable accuracy as an extended, linearly elastic polymer. Three main approaches are considered: mechanical equilibrium methods, which seek to compute minimum energy conformations of topologically constrained molecules; statistical mechanical methods, which seek to compute the Boltzmann distribution of equilibrium conformations that arise in a finite temperature environment; and dynamic methods, which seek to compute deterministic trajectories of the helix axis by solving equations of motion. When these methods include forces of self-contact, which prevent strand passage and preserve the topological constraint, each predicts plectonemically interwound structures. On the other hand, the extent to which these mechanical methods reliably predict energetic and thermodynamic properties of superhelical molecules is limited, in part because of their inability to account explicitly for interactions involving solvent. Monte Carlo methods predict the entropy associated with supercoiling to be negative, in conflict with a body of experimental evidence that finds it is large and positive, as would be the case if superhelical deformations significantly disrupt the ordering of ambient solvent molecules. This suggests that the large-scale conformational properties predicted by elastomechanical models are not the only ones determining the energetics and thermodynamics of supercoiling. Moreover, because all such models that preserve the topological constraint correctly predict plectonemic interwinding, despite these and other limitations, this constraint evidently dominates energetic and thermodynamic factors in determining supercoil geometry. Therefore, agreement between predicted structures and structures obtained experimentally, for example, by electron microscopy, does not in itself provide evidence for the correctness or completeness of any given model of DNA mechanics.},

abstract = {We consider the analysis of a class of experiments in which the number of photons in consecutive time intervals is recorded. Sequence of photon counts or, alternatively, of FRET efficiencies can be studied using likelihood-based methods. For a kinetic model of the conformational dynamics and state-dependent Poisson photon statistics, the formalism to calculate the exact likelihood that this model describes such sequences of photons or FRET efficiencies is developed. Explicit analytic expressions for the likelihood function for a two-state kinetic model are provided. The important special case when conformational dynamics are so slow that at most a single transition occurs in a time bin is considered. By making a series of approximations, we eventually recover the likelihood function used in hidden Markov models. In this way, not only is insight gained into the range of validity of this procedure, but also an improved likelihood function can be obtained.},

abstract = {The thermal stability of nucleic acid structures is perturbed under the conditions that mimic the intracellular environment, typically rich in inert components and under osmotic stress. We now describe the thermodynamic stability of DNA oligonucleotide structures in the presence of high background concentrations of neutral cosolutes. Small cosolutes destabilize the basepair structures, and the DNA structures consisting of the same nearest-neighbor composition show similar thermodynamic parameters in the presence of various types of cosolutes. The osmotic stress experiments reveal that water binding to flexible loops, unstable mismatches, and an abasic site upon DNA folding are almost negligible, whereas the binding to stable mismatch pairs is significant. The studies using the basepair-mimic nucleosides and the peptide nucleic acid suggest that the sugar-phosphate backbone and the integrity of the basepair conformation make important contributions to the binding of water molecules to the DNA bases and helical grooves. The study of the DNA hydration provides the basis for understanding and predicting nucleic acid structures in nonaqueous solvent systems.},

abstract = {Large-scale DNA deformation is ubiquitous in transcriptional regulation in prokaryotes and eukaryotes alike. Though much is known about how transcription factors and constellations of binding sites dictate where and how gene regulation will occur, less is known about the role played by the intervening DNA. In this work we explore the effect of sequence flexibility on transcription factor-mediated DNA looping, by drawing on sequences identified in nucleosome formation and ligase-mediated cyclization assays as being especially favorable for or resistant to large deformations. We examine a poly(dA:dT)-rich, nucleosome-repelling sequence that is often thought to belong to a class of highly inflexible DNAs; two strong nucleosome positioning sequences that share a set of particular sequence features common to nucleosome-preferring DNAs; and a CG-rich sequence representative of high G+C-content genomic regions that correlate with high nucleosome occupancy in vivo. To measure the flexibility of these sequences in the context of DNA looping, we combine the in vitro single-molecule tethered particle motion assay, a canonical looping protein, and a statistical mechanical model that allows us to quantitatively relate the looping probability to the looping free energy. We show that, in contrast to the case of nucleosome occupancy, G+C content does not positively correlate with looping probability, and that despite sharing sequence features that are thought to determine nucleosome affinity, the two strong nucleosome positioning sequences behave markedly dissimilarly in the context of looping. Most surprisingly, the poly(dA:dT)-rich DNA that is often characterized as highly inflexible in fact exhibits one of the highest propensities for looping that we have measured. These results argue for a need to revisit our understanding of the mechanical properties of DNA in a way that will provide a basis for understanding DNA deformation over the entire range of biologically relevant scenarios that are impacted by DNA deformability.},

abstract = {We present a study of the hybridization of complementary DNA hairpin loops, with particular reference to their use as fuel for autonomous DNA devices. The rate of spontaneous hybridization between complementary hairpins can be reduced by increasing the neck length or decreasing the loop length. Hairpins with larger loops rapidly form long-lived kissed complexes. Hairpin loops may be opened by strand displacement using an opening strand that contains the same sequence as half of the neck and a "toehold" complementary to a single-stranded domain adjacent to the neck. We find loop opening via an external toehold to be 10-100 times faster than via an internal toehold. We measure rates of loop opening by opening strands that are at least 1000 times faster than the spontaneous interaction between hairpins. We discuss suitable choices for loop, neck, and toehold length for hairpin loops to be used as fuel for autonomous DNA devices.},

abstract = {To acquire accurate structural and dynamical information on complex biomolecular machines using single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (sm-FRET), a large flux of donor and acceptor photons is needed. To achieve such fluxes, one may use higher laser excitation intensity; however, this induces increased rates of photobleaching. Anti-oxidant additives have been extensively used for reducing acceptor's photobleaching. Here we focus on deciphering the initial step along the photobleaching pathway. Utilizing an array of recently developed single-molecule and ensemble spectroscopies and doubly labeled Acyl-CoA binding protein and double-stranded DNA as model systems, we study these photobleaching pathways, which place fundamental limitations on sm-FRET experiments. We find that: (i) acceptor photobleaching scales with FRET efficiency, (ii) acceptor photobleaching is enhanced under picosecond-pulsed (vs continuous-wave) excitation, and (iii) acceptor photobleaching scales with the intensity of only the short wavelength (donor) excitation laser. We infer from these findings that the main pathway for acceptor's photobleaching is through absorption of a short wavelength photon from the acceptor's first excited singlet state and that donor's photobleaching is usually not a concern. We conclude by suggesting the use of short pulses for donor excitation, among other possible remedies, for reducing acceptor's photobleaching in sm-FRET measurements.},

abstract = {Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) is being applied increasingly to study diffusion and interactions of fluorescently labeled macromolecules in complex biological systems. Fluctuations in detected fluorescence, deltaF(t), are expressed as time-correlation functions, G(tau), and photon-count histograms, P(k;DeltaT). Here, we developed a generalized simulation approach to compute G(tau) and P(k;DeltaT) for complex systems with arbitrary geometry, photophysics, diffusion, and macromolecular interactions. G(tau) and P(k;DeltaT) were computed from deltaF(t) generated by a Brownian dynamics simulation of single-molecule trajectories followed by a Monte Carlo simulation of fluorophore excitation and detection statistics. Simulations were validated by comparing analytical and simulated G(tau) and P(k;DeltaT) for diffusion of noninteracting fluorophores in a three-dimensional Gaussian excitation and detection volume. Inclusion of photobleaching and triplet-state relaxation produced significant changes in G(tau) and P(k;DeltaT). Simulations of macromolecular interactions and complex diffusion were done, including transient fluorophore binding to an immobile matrix, cross-correlation analysis of interacting fluorophores, and anomalous sub- and superdiffusion. The computational method developed here is generally applicable for simulating FCS measurements on systems complicated by fluorophore interactions or molecular crowding, and experimental protocols for which G(tau) and P(k;DeltaT) cannot be computed analytically.},

The predicted hydration sites correctly reproduce the main features of hydration around the B-DNA dodecamer. In contrast to the previous observations, the newly available crystal data show the same extent of hydration of guanine and adenine, and of cytosine and thymine.},

abstract = {We present a comprehensive toolkit for F\"{o}rster resonance energy transfer (FRET)-restrained modeling of biomolecules and their complexes for quantitative applications in structural biology. A dramatic improvement in the precision of FRET-derived structures is achieved by explicitly considering spatial distributions of dye positions, which greatly reduces uncertainties due to flexible dye linkers. The precision and confidence levels of the models are calculated by rigorous error estimation. The accuracy of this approach is demonstrated by docking a DNA primer-template to HIV-1 reverse transcriptase. The derived model agrees with the known X-ray structure with an r.m.s. deviation of 0.5 \AA. Furthermore, we introduce FRET-guided 'screening' of a large structural ensemble created by molecular dynamics simulations. We used this hybrid approach to determine the formerly unknown configuration of the flexible single-strand template overhang.},

abstract = {Single molecule fluorescent microscopy is a method for the analysis of the dynamics of biological macromolecules by detecting the fluorescence signal produced by fluorophores associated with the macromolecule. Two fluorophores located in a close proximity may result in F\"{o}rster resonance energy transfer (FRET), which can be detected at the single molecule level and the efficiency of energy transfer calculated. In most cases, the experimentally observed distribution of FRET efficiency exhibits a significant width corresponding to 0.07-0.2 (on a scale of 0-1). Here, we present a general approach describing the analysis of experimental data for a DNA/RNA duplex. We have found that for a 15 bp duplex with Cy3 and Cy5 fluorophores attached to the opposite ends of the helix, the width of the energy transfer distribution is mainly determined by the photon shot noise and the orientation factor, whereas the variation of inter-dye distances plays a minor role.},

abstract = {Simultaneous measurements on the packing and energetics of high-density liquid crystalline DNA phases show that the crowding of long DNA polyelectrolytes at ever increasing concentrations is accomplished through straightening of the random coils that the double helix assumes in dilute solution. X-ray scattering by ordered phases reveals that the local straightening of the molecules is also accompanied by their progressive immobilization and confinement within the molecular 'cages' created by neighboring molecules. These effects can be clearly observed through the measured energies of DNA packing under osmotic stress and through the changes in structural and dynamic characteristics of X-ray scattering from DNA in ordered arrays at different concentrations. The character of the confinement of large DNA motions for a wide range of DNA concentrations is dominated by the soft potentials of direct interaction. We do not see the power-law variation of energy vs. volume expected from space-filling fluctuations of molecules that enjoy no interaction except the hard clash of steric repulsion. Rather, in highly concentrated DNA mesophases we see a crowding of molecules through electrostatic or hydration repulsion that confines their movements and positions. This view is based on directly measured packing energies as well as on concurrently measured structural parameters while the DNA double helices are condensed under an externally applied osmotic pressure.},

abstract = {We present advances in the use of single-molecule FRET measurements with flexibly linked dyes to derive full 3D structures of DNA constructs based on absolute distances. The resolution obtained by this single-molecule approach harbours the potential to study in detail also protein- or damage-induced DNA bending. If one is to generate a geometric structural model, distances between fixed positions are needed. These are usually not experimentally accessible because of unknown fluorophore-linker mobility effects that lead to a distribution of FRET efficiencies and distances. To solve this problem, we performed studies on DNA double-helices by systematically varying donor acceptor distances from 2 to 10 nm. Analysis of dye-dye quenching and fluorescence anisotropy measurements reveal slow positional and fast orientational fluorophore dynamics, that results in an isotropic average of the FRET efficiency. We use a nonlinear conversion function based on MD simulations that allows us to include this effect in the calculation of absolute FRET distances. To obtain unique structures, we performed a quantitative statistical analysis for the conformational search in full space based on triangulation, which uses the known helical nucleic acid features. Our higher accuracy allowed the detection of sequence-dependent DNA bending by 16 degrees . For DNA with bulged adenosines, we also quantified the kink angles introduced by the insertion of 1, 3 and 5 bases to be 32 degrees +/- 6 degrees , 56 degrees +/- 4 degrees and 73 +/- 2 degrees , respectively. Moreover, the rotation angles and shifts of the helices were calculated to describe the relative orientation of the two arms in detail.},

abstract = {This experimental design presents a single molecule approach based on fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) for the quantification of outer membrane proteins which are receptors to an aptamer specifically designed to target the surface receptors of live Salmonella typhimurium. By using correlation analysis, we also show that it is possible to determine the associated binding kinetics of these aptamers on live single cells. Aptamers are specific oligonucleotides designed to recognize conserved sequences that bind to receptors with high affinity, and therefore can be integrated into selective biosensor platforms. In our experiments, aptamers were constructed to bind to outer membrane proteins of S. typhimurium and were assessed for specificity against Escherichia coli. By fluorescently labeling aptamer probes and applying FCS, we were able to study the diffusion dynamics of bound and unbound aptamers and compare them to determine the dissociation constants and receptor densities of the bacteria for each aptamer at single molecule sensitivity. The dissociation constants for these aptamer probes calculated from autocorrelation data were 0.1285 and 0.3772 nM and the respective receptor densities were 42.27 receptors per µm(2) and 49.82 receptors per µm(2). This study provides ample evidence that the number of surface receptors is sufficient for binding and that both aptamers have a high-binding affinity and can therefore be used in detection processes. The methods developed here are unique and can be generalized to examine surface binding kinetics and receptor quantification in live bacteria at single molecule sensitivity levels. The impact of this study is broad because our approach can provide a methodology for biosensor construction and calculation of live single cell receptor-ligand kinetics in a variety of environmental and biological applications.},

abstract = {Two procedures based on the weighted least-squares (LS) and the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) method to confidently analyze single-molecule (SM) fluorescence decays with a total number (N) of 2,500-60,000 counts have been elucidated and experimentally compared by analyzing measured bulk and SM decays. The key observation of this comparison is that the LS systematically underestimates the fluorescence lifetimes by approximately 5\%, for the range of 1,000-20,000 events, whereas the MLE method gives stable results over the whole intensity range, even at counts N less than 1,000, where the LS analysis delivers unreasonable values. This difference can be attributed to the different statistics approaches and results from improper weighting of the LS method. As expected from theory, the results of both methods become equivalent above a certain threshold of N detected photons per decay, which is here experimentally determined to be approximately 20,000. In contrast to the bulk lifetime distributions, the SM fluorescence lifetime distributions exhibit standard deviations that are sizably larger than the statistically expected values. This comparison proves the strong influence of the inhomogenuous microenvironment on the photophysical behavior of single molecules embedded in a 10-30-nm thin polymer layer.},

abstract = {A quadrant photodiode placed in the back-focal plane of the microscope of a laser trap provides a high-resolution position sensor. We show that in addition to the lateral displacement of a trapped sphere, its axial position can be measured by the ratio of the intensity of scattered laser light to the total amount of the light reaching the detector. The addition of the axial information offers true three-dimensional position detection in solution, creating, together with a position control, a photonic force microscope with nanometer spatial and microsecond temporal resolution. The measured position signals are explained as interference of the unscattered trapping laser beam with the laser light scattered by the trapped bead. Our model explains experimental data for trapped particles in the Rayleigh regime (radius a <0.2lambda) for displacements up to the focal dimensions. The cross-talk between the signals in the three directions is explained and it is shown that this cross-talk can be neglected for lateral displacements smaller than 75 nm and axial displacements below 150 nm. The advantages of three-dimensional single-particle tracking over conventional video-tracking are shown through the example of the diffusion of the GPI-anchored membrane protein Thy1.1 on a neurite.},

abstract = {In this paper, we present a varitional Bayes (VB) framework for learning continuous hidden Markov models (CHMMs), and we examine the VB framework within active learning. Unlike a maximum likelihood or maximum a posteriori training procedure, which yield a point estimate of the CHMM parameters, VB-based training yields an estimate of the full posterior of the model parameters. This is particularly important for small training sets since it gives a measure of confidence in the accuracy of the learned model. This is utilized within the context of active learning, for which we acquire labels for those feature vectors for which knowledge of the associated label would be most informative for reducing model-parameter uncertainty. Three active learning algorithms are considered in this paper: 1) query by committee (QBC), with the goal of selecting data for labeling that minimize the classification variance, 2) a maximum expected information gain method that seeks to label data with the goal of reducing the entropy of the model parameters, and 3) an error-reduction-based procedure that attempts to minimize classification error over the test data. The experimental results are presented for synthetic and measured data. We demonstrate that all of these active learning methods can significantly reduce the amount of required labeling, compared to random selection of samples for labeling.},

@article{Cao2009,
abstract = {Based on an ensemble of kinetically accessible conformations, we propose a new analytical model for RNA folding kinetics. The model gives populational kinetics, kinetic rates, transition states, and pathways from the rate matrix. Applications of the new kinetic model to mechanical folding of RNA hairpins such as trans-activation-responsive RNA reveal distinct kinetic behaviors in different force regimes, from zero force to forces much stronger than the critical force for the folding-unfolding transition. In the absence of force or a low force, folding can be initiated (nucleated) at any position by forming the first base stack and there exist many pathways for the folding process. In contrast, for a higher force, the folding/unfolding would predominantly proceed along a single zipping/unzipping pathway. Studies for different hairpin-forming sequences indicate that depending on the nucleotide sequence, a kinetic intermediate can emerge in the low force regime but disappear in high force regime, and a new kinetic intermediate, which is absent in the low and high force regimes, can emerge in the medium force range. Variations of the force lead to changes in folding cooperativity and rate-limiting steps. The predicted network of pathways for trans-activation-responsive RNA suggests two parallel dominant pathways. The rate-limiting folding steps (at f = 8 pN) are the formation of specific basepairs that are 2-4 basepairs away from the loop. At a higher force (f = 11 pN), the folding rate is controlled by the formation of the bulge loop. The predicted rates and transition states are in good agreement with the experimental data for a broad force regime.},

abstract = {DNA is thought to behave as a stiff elastic rod with respect to the ubiquitous mechanical deformations inherent to its biology. To test this model at short DNA lengths, we measured the mean and variance of end-to-end length for a series of DNA double helices in solution, using small-angle x-ray scattering interference between gold nanocrystal labels. In the absence of applied tension, DNA is at least one order of magnitude softer than measured by single-molecule stretching experiments. Further, the data rule out the conventional elastic rod model. The variance in end-to-end length follows a quadratic dependence on the number of base pairs rather than the expected linear dependence, indicating that DNA stretching is cooperative over more than two turns of the DNA double helix. Our observations support the idea of long-range allosteric communication through DNA structure.},

abstract = {We provide a critical examination of two different methods for generating a donor-acceptor electronic coupling trajectory from a molecular dynamics (MD) trajectory and three methods for sampling that coupling trajectory, allowing the modeling of experimental observables directly from the MD simulation. In the first coupling method we perform a single quantum-mechanical (QM) calculation to characterize the excited state behavior, specifically the transition dipole moment, of the fluorescent probe, which is then mapped onto the configuration space sampled by MD. We then utilize these transition dipoles within the ideal dipole approximation (IDA) to determine the electronic coupling between the probes that mediates the transfer of energy. In the second method we perform a QM calculation on each snapshot and use the complete transition densities to calculate the electronic coupling without need for the IDA. The resulting coupling trajectories are then sampled using three methods ranging from an independent sampling of each trajectory point (the independent snapshot method) to a Markov chain treatment that accounts for the dynamics of the coupling in determining effective rates. The results show that the IDA significantly overestimates the energy transfer rate (by a factor of 2.6) during the portions of the trajectory in which the probes are close to each other. Comparison of the sampling methods shows that the Markov chain approach yields more realistic observables at both high and low FRET efficiencies. Differences between the three sampling methods are discussed in terms of the different mechanisms for averaging over structural dynamics in the system. Convergence of the Markov chain method is carefully examined. Together, the methods for estimating coupling and for sampling the coupling provide a mechanism for directly connecting the structural dynamics modeled by MD with fluorescence observables determined through FRET experiments.},

abstract = {We report the development of a scanning lifetime fluorescence microscope using the asynchronous, pump-probe (stimulated emission) approach. There are two significant advantages of this technique. First, the cross-correlation signal produced by overlapping the pump and probe lasers results in i) an axial sectioning effect similar to that in confocal and two-photon excitation microscopy, and ii) improved spatial resolution compared to conventional one-photon fluorescence microscopy. Second, the low-frequency, cross-correlation signal generated allows lifetime-resolved imaging without using fast photodetectors. The data presented here include 1) determination of laser sources' threshold powers for linearity in the pump-probe signal; 2) characterization of the pump-probe intensity profile using 0.28 microns fluorescent latex spheres; 3) high frequency (up to 6.7 GHz) lifetime measurement of rhodamine B in water; and 4) lifetime-resolved images of fluorescent latex spheres, human erythrocytes and a mouse fibroblast cell stained by rhodamine DHPE, and a mouse fibroblast labeled with ethidium bromide and rhodamine DHPE.},

abstract = {Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) is an important source of long-range distance information in macromolecules. However, extracting maximum information requires knowledge of fluorophore, donor and acceptor, positions on the macromolecule. We previously determined the structure of the indocarbocyanine fluorophores Cy3 and Cy5 attached to DNA via three-carbon atom tethers, showing that they stacked onto the end of the helix in a manner similar to an additional basepair. Our recent FRET study has suggested that when they are attached via a longer 13-atom tether, these fluorophores are repositioned relative to the terminal basepair by a rotation of ∼30°, while remaining stacked. In this study, we have used NMR to extend our structural understanding to the commonly used fluorophore sulfoindocarbocyanine-3 (sCy3) attached to the 5'-terminus of the double-helical DNA via a 13-atom flexible tether (L13). We find that L13-sCy3 remains predominantly stacked onto the end of the duplex, but adopts a significantly different conformation, from that of either Cy3 or Cy5 attached by 3-atom tethers, with the long axes of the fluorophore and the terminal basepair approximately parallel. This result is in close agreement with our FRET data, supporting the contention that FRET data can be used to provide orientational information.},

abstract = {We present a PC-based multi-tau software correlator suitable for processing dynamic light-scattering data. The correlator is based on a simple algorithm that was developed with the graphical programming language LabVIEW, according to which the incoming data are processed on line without any storage on the hard disk. By use of a standard photon-counting unit, a National Instruments Model 6602-PCI timer-counter, and a 550-MHz Pentium III personal computer, correlation functions can be worked out in full real-time over time scales of \~{}5 mus and in batch processing down to time scales of \~{}300 ns. The latter limit is imposed by the speed of data transfer between the counter and the PC's memory and thus is prone to be progressively reduced with future technological development. Testing of the correlator and evaluation of its performances were carried out by use of dilute solutions of calibrated polystyrene spheres. Our results indicate that the correlation functions are determined with such precision that the corresponding particle diameters can be recovered to within an accuracy of a few percent rms.},

@article{iqbal2008orientation,
abstract = {We have found that the efficiency of fluorescence resonance energy transfer between Cy3 and Cy5 terminally attached to the 5' ends of a DNA duplex is significantly affected by the relative orientation of the two fluorophores. The cyanine fluorophores are predominantly stacked on the ends of the helix in the manner of an additional base pair, and thus their relative orientation depends on the length of the helix. Observed fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) efficiency depends on the length of the helix, as well as its helical periodicity. By changing the helical geometry from B form double-stranded DNA to A form hybrid RNA/DNA, a marked phase shift occurs in the modulation of FRET efficiency with helix length. Both curves are well explained by the standard geometry of B and A form helices. The observed modulation for both polymers is less than that calculated for a fully rigid attachment of the fluorophores. However, a model involving lateral mobility of the fluorophores on the ends of the helix explains the observed experimental data. This has been further modified to take account of a minor fraction of unstacked fluorophore observed by fluorescent lifetime measurements. Our data unequivocally establish that F\"{o}rster transfer obeys the orientation dependence as expected for a dipole-dipole interaction.},

abstract = {A method of sample analysis is presented which is based on fitting a joint distribution of photon count numbers. In experiments, fluorescence from a microscopic volume containing a fluctuating number of molecules is monitored by two detectors, using a confocal microscope. The two detectors may have different polarizational or spectral responses. Concentrations of fluorescent species together with two specific brightness values per species are determined. The two-dimensional fluorescence intensity distribution analysis (2D-FIDA), if used with a polarization cube, is a tool that is able to distinguish fluorescent species with different specific polarization ratios. As an example of polarization studies by 2D-FIDA, binding of 5'-(6-carboxytetramethylrhodamine) (TAMRA)-labeled theophylline to an anti-theophylline antibody has been studied. Alternatively, if two-color equipment is used, 2D-FIDA can determine concentrations and specific brightness values of fluorescent species corresponding to individual labels alone and their complex. As an example of two-color 2D-FIDA, binding of TAMRA-labeled somatostatin-14 to the human type-2 high-affinity somatostatin receptors present in stained vesicles has been studied. The presented method is unusually accurate among fluorescence fluctuation methods. It is well suited for monitoring a variety of molecular interactions, including receptors and ligands or antibodies and antigens.},

abstract = {Recent theoretical studies performed on the folding/unfolding mechanism of the model telomeric human DNA, 5'-AGGGTTAGGGTTAGGGTTAGGG-3' (Tel22), have indicated that in the presence of K(+) ions Tel22 folds into two hybrid G-quadruplex structures characterized by one double and two reversal TTA loops arranged in a different way. They predicted a new unfolding pathway from the initial mixture of hybrid G-quadruplexes via the corresponding intermediate triplex structures into the final, fully unfolded state. Significantly, no experimental evidence supporting the suggested pathway has been reported. In the current work, we performed a comprehensive global thermodynamic analysis of calorimetric (DSC, ITC) and spectroscopic (CD) data obtained on monitoring the folding/unfolding of Tel22 induced by changes of temperature and K(+) concentration. We show that unfolding of Tel22 may be described as a monomolecular equilibrium three-state process that involves thermodynamically distinguishable folded (F), intermediate (I), and unfolded (U) state. Considering that calorimetric methods cannot distinguish between energetically similar G-quadruplex or triplex conformations predicted by the theoretical model one can conclude that our results represent the first experimental support of the suggested unfolding/folding mechanism of Tel22. This conclusion is confirmed by the fact that the estimated number of K(+) ions released upon each unfolding step in our thermodynamic model agrees well with the corresponding values predicted by the theoretical model and that the observed changes in enthalpy, entropy, and heat capacity accompanying the F → I and I → U transitions can be reasonably explained only if the intermediate state I is considered to be a triplex structural conformation.},

abstract = {It has been argued that the stacking of adenyl groups in water must be driven primarily by electrostatic interactions, based upon NMR data showing stacking for two adenyl groups joined by a 3-atom linker but not for two naphthyl groups joined by the same linker. In contrast, theoretical work has suggested that adenine stacking is driven primarily by nonelectrostatic forces, and that electrostatic interactions actually produce a net repulsion between adenines stacking in water. The present study provides evidence that the experimental data for the 3-atom-linked bis-adenyl and bis-naphthyl compounds are consistent with the theory indicating that nonelectrostatic interactions drive adenine stacking. First, a theoretical conformational analysis is found to reproduce the observed ranking of the stacking tendencies of the compounds studied experimentally. A geometric analysis identifies two possible reasons, other than stronger electrostatic interactions, why the 3-atom-linked bis-adenyl compounds should stack more than the bis-naphthyl compounds. First, stacked naphthyl groups tend to lie further apart than stacked adenyl groups, based upon both quantum calculations and crystal structures. This may prevent the bis-naphthyl compound from stacking as extensively as the bis-adenyl compound. Second, geometric analysis shows that more stacked conformations are sterically accessible to the bis-adenyl compound than to the bis-naphthyl compound because the linker is attached to the sides of the adenyl groups, but to the ends of the naphthyl groups. Finally, ab initio quantum mechanics calculations and energy decompositions for relevant conformations of adenine and naphthalene dimers support the view that stacking in these compounds is driven primarily by nonelectrostatic interactions. The present analysis illustrates the importance of considering all aspects of a molecular system when interpreting experimental data, and the value of computer models as an adjunct to chemical intuition.},

abstract = {Single-stranded guanine (G)-rich sequences at the 3' end of human telomeres provide ample opportunities for physiologically relevant structures, such as G-quadruplexes, to form and interconvert. Population equilibrium in this long sequence is expected to be intricate and beyond the resolution of ensemble-average techniques, such as circular dichroism, NMR, or X-ray crystallography. By combining a force-jump method at the single-molecular level and a statistical population deconvolution at the sub-nanometer resolution, we reveal a complex population network with unprecedented transition dynamics in human telomeric sequences that contain four to eight TTAGGG repeats. Our kinetic data firmly establish that G-triplexes are intermediates to G-quadruplexes while long-loop G-quadruplexes are misfolded population minorities whose formation and disassembly are faster than G-triplexes or regular G-quadruplexes. The existence of misfolded DNA supports the emerging view that structural and kinetic complexities of DNA can rival those of RNA or proteins. While G-quadruplexes are the most prevalent species in all the sequences studied, the abundance of a misfolded G-quadruplex in a particular telomeric sequence decreases with an increase in the loop length or the number of long-loops in the structure. These population patterns support the prediction that in the full-length 3' overhang of human telomeres, G-quadruplexes with shortest TTA loops would be the most dominant species, which justifies the modeling role of regular G-quadruplexes in the investigation of telomeric structures.},

abstract = {Single-molecule techniques facilitate analysis of mechanical transitions within nucleic acids and proteins. Here, we describe an integrated fluorescence and magnetic tweezers instrument that permits detection of nanometer-scale DNA structural rearrangements together with the application of a wide range of stretching forces to individual DNA molecules. We have analyzed the force-dependent equilibrium and rate constants for telomere DNA G-quadruplex (GQ) folding and unfolding, and have determined the location of the transition state barrier along the well-defined DNA-stretching reaction coordinate. Our results reveal the mechanical unfolding pathway of the telomere DNA GQ is characterized by a short distance (<1 nm) to the transition state for the unfolding reaction. This mechanical unfolding response reflects a critical contribution of long-range interactions to the global stability of the GQ fold, and suggests that telomere-associated proteins need only disrupt a few base pairs to destabilize GQ structures. Comparison of the GQ unfolded state with a single-stranded polyT DNA revealed the unfolded GQ exhibits a compacted non-native conformation reminiscent of the protein molten globule. We expect the capacity to interrogate macromolecular structural transitions with high spatial resolution under conditions of low forces will have broad application in analyses of nucleic acid and protein folding.},

abstract = {Upon increasing the concentration of ethylene glycol (EG) at 378C, the twist energy parameter, ET, which governs the supercoiling free energy, was recently found to undergo a decreasing (or reverse) sigmoidal transition with a midpoint near 20 w/v\%EG. In this study, the effects of adding 20 w/v\% EG on the torsion elastic constant (a) of linear p30d DNA and on the hydrodynamic radius (RH) of a synthetic 24 bp duplex DNAwere examined at both 40 and 208C. The time- resolved fluorescence intensity and fluorescence polarization anisotropy (FPA) of intercalated ethidium were measured in order to assess the effects of 20 w/v \% EG on: (1) a; (2) RH; (3) the lifetimes of intercalated and non-intercalated dye; (4) the amplitude of dye wobble in its binding site; and (5) the binding constant for intercalation. The effects of 20 w/v \%EG on the circular dichroism (CD) spectrum of the DNA and on the emission spectrum of the free dye were also measured. At 408C, addition of 20 w/v\% EG caused a substantial (1.27- to 1.35-fold) increase in a, a significant change in the CD spectrum, and a very small, marginally significant increase in RH, but little or no change in the amplitude of dye wobble in its binding site or the lifetime Correspondence to: J. Michael Schurr; e-mail: schurr@chem.washington.edu Contract grant sponsor: National Institutes of Health Contract grant number: RO1 GM61685 of intercalated dye. Together with previously reported measurements of ET, these results imply that the bending elastic constant of DNA is significantly decreased by 20 w/v \%EG at 408C. At 208C, addition of 20 w/v\% EG caused a marginally significant decrease in a and very little change in any other measured properties. Also at 208C, addition of 30 w/v\% betaine caused a marginally significant increase in a and significant but modest change in the CD spectrum, but very little change in any other properties. \# 2006Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

abstract = {Cyanine dyes are extensively used as fluorescent probes in molecular biology, biochemical and biophysical applications. We investigated the fluorescent properties of Cy3 covalently attached to the 5' terminus of DNA oligonucleotides, and demonstrated that its fluorescence efficiency and lifetime depend strongly on DNA sequence. DNA sequence determines the extent and nature of the interactions between the dye and the DNA bases, which are responsible for the unusual enhancement in fluorescence observed for a large number of oligonucleotides. Results are discussed in terms of a photoisomerization mechanism that deactivates the excited state and thus competes with fluorescence. The efficiency of isomerization decreases when Cy3-DNA interactions prevent rotation around the double bonds, resulting in an increase in the lifetime of the singlet excited state. We have shown that the ability of Cy3 to interact with DNA depends on the flexibility of the oligonucleotide and the presence of purines in the chain.},

abstract = {To determine whether Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET) measurements can provide quantitative distance information in single-molecule fluorescence experiments on polypeptides, we measured FRET efficiency distributions for donor and acceptor dyes attached to the ends of freely diffusing polyproline molecules of various lengths. The observed mean FRET efficiencies agree with those determined from ensemble lifetime measurements but differ considerably from the values expected from Forster theory, with polyproline treated as a rigid rod. At donor-acceptor distances much less than the Forster radius R(0), the observed efficiencies are lower than predicted, whereas at distances comparable to and greater than R(0), they are much higher. Two possible contributions to the former are incomplete orientational averaging during the donor lifetime and, because of the large size of the dyes, breakdown of the point-dipole approximation assumed in Forster theory. End-to-end distance distributions and correlation times obtained from Langevin molecular dynamics simulations suggest that the differences for the longer polyproline peptides can be explained by chain bending, which considerably shortens the donor-acceptor distances.},

abstract = {We present the theory for the distribution of the number of donor and acceptor photons detected in a time bin and the corresponding energy-transfer efficiency distribution obtained from single-molecule Forster resonance energy-transfer measurements. Photon counts from both immobilized and freely diffusing molecules are considered. Our starting point is the joint distribution for the donor and acceptor photons for a system described by an arbitrary kinetic scheme. This is simplified by exploiting the time scale separation between fast fluorescent transitions and slow processes which include conformational dynamics, intersystem conversion to a dark state, and translational diffusion in and out of the laser spot. The fast fluorescent transitions result in a Poisson distribution of the number of photons which is then averaged over slow fluctuations of the local transfer efficiency and the total number of photons. The contribution of various processes to the distribution and the variance of the energy-transfer efficiency are analyzed.},

abstract = {The blinking kinetics of individual Cy5 fluorophores conjugated to DNA are directly measured using single-molecule spectroscopy. Under deoxygenated aqueous conditions, Cy5 fluorescence exhibits spontaneous and reversible on/off fluctuations with a period lasting seconds. This blinking is observed when directly exciting Cy5 with 640 nm light and by Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET). We find that Cy5 blinking is influenced by the proximity of the donor, the structure of the donor, the presence of 514 nm excitation, and FRET. In the context of single-molecule FRET, blinking of the acceptor produces anticorrelated donor-acceptor intensity fluctuations, which can be difficult to discern from variations in the interdye distance. Slow blinking is, in particular, problematic because it overlaps with biologically relevant time scales. By employing an alternating 514640 nm laser excitation scheme, we show that the dark states can be readily resolved and discriminated from FRET distance fluctuations.},

abstract = {Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) is a technique used to measure the interaction between two molecules labeled with two different fluorophores (the donor and the acceptor) by the transfer of energy from the excited donor to the acceptor. In biological applications, this technique has become popular to qualitatively map protein-protein interactions, and in biophysical projects it is used as a quantitative measure for distances between a single donor and acceptor molecule. Numerous approaches can be found in the literature to quantify and map FRET, but the measures they provide are often difficult to interpret. We propose here a quantitative comparison of these methods by using a surface FRET system with controlled amounts of donor and acceptor fluorophores and controlled distances between them. We support the system with a Monte Carlo simulation of FRET, which provides reference values for the FRET efficiency under various experimental conditions. We validate a representative set of FRET efficiencies and indices calculated from the different methods with different experimental settings. Finally, we test their sensitivity and draw conclusions for the preparation of FRET experiments in more complex and less-controlled systems.},

abstract = {To solve details of the self-assembling process of guanosine in diluted aqueous solution and to derive a thermodynamical model for quadruplex formation, the structural behavior of deoxyguanosine 5'-monophosphate has been analyzed by in-solution small angle X-ray scattering. The experiments have been performed as a function of guanosine concentration and at fixed guanosine concentration but in the presence of varying amounts of KCl. As a result, the self-assembling process, in terms of both aggregate particle fractions and aggregate length, has been observed to be strongly dependent on composition and largely affected by excess potassium ions in the solution. In particular, the different aggregate forms have been resolved and their concentration derived as a function of sample composition. In accordance with a hierarchical aggregation process, a nucleation and elongation mechanism has been used to derive the thermodynamical parameters for self-assembling. The results show that the annealing and fragmentation steps play an important role in the aggregation process.},

abstract = {Fluorescence anisotropy and fluorescence correlation spectroscopy measurements of rhodamine-labeled DNA oligonucleotide duplexes have been used to determine equilibrium binding constants for DNA binding of the prokaryotic transcription activator protein NtrC. Measurements were made with wild-type NtrC from Escherichia coli and the constitutively active mutant NtrCS160Ffrom Salmonella using DNA duplexes with one or two binding sites. The following results were obtained: (i) the dissociation constant K d for binding of one NtrC dimer to a single binding site was the same for the wild-type and mutant proteins within the error of measurement. (ii) The value of K d decreased from 1.4 +/- 0.7 x 10(-11) M at 15 mM K acetate to 5.8 +/- 2.6 x 10(-9) M at 600 mM K acetate. From the salt dependence of the dissociation constant we calculated that two ion pairs form upon binding of one dimeric protein to the DNA. (iii) Binding of two NtrC dimers to the DNA duplex with two binding sites occured with essentially no cooperativity. Titration curves of NtrCS160Fbinding to the same duplex demonstrated that more than two protein dimers of the mutant protein could bind to the DNA.},

abstract = {Intramolecular dynamics play an essential role in the folding and function of biomolecules and, increasingly, in the operation of many biomimetic technologies. Thus motivated we have employed both experiment and simulation to characterize the end-to-end collision dynamics of unstructured, single-stranded DNAs ranging from 6 to 26 bases. We find that, because of the size and flexibility of the optical reporters employed experimentally, end-to-end collision dynamics exhibit little length dependence at length scales <11 bases. For longer constructs, however, the end-to-end collision rate exhibits a power-law relationship to polymer length with an exponent of -3.49 +/- 0.13. This represents a significantly stronger length dependence than observed experimentally for unstructured polypeptides or predicted by polymer scaling arguments. Simulations indicate, however, that the larger exponent stems from electrostatic effects that become important over the rather short length scale of these highly charged polymers. Finally, we have found that the end-to-end collision rate also depends linearly on solvent viscosity, with an experimentally significant, nonzero intercept (the extrapolated rate at zero viscosity) that is independent of chain length--n observation that sheds new light on the origins of the "internal friction" observed in the dynamics of many polymer systems.},

abstract = {We have determined the temperature dependence of DNA persistence length, a, using two different methods. The first approach was based on measuring the j-factors of short DNA fragments at various temperatures. Fitting the measured j-factors by the theoretical equation allowed us to obtain the values of a for temperatures between 5°C and 42°C. The second approach was based on measuring the equilibrium distribution of the linking number between the strands of circular DNA at different temperatures. The major contribution into the distribution variance comes from the fluctuations of DNA writhe in the nicked circular molecules which are specified by the value of a. The computation-based analysis of the measured variances was used to obtain the values of a for temperatures up to 60°C. We found a good agreement between the results obtained by these two methods. Our data show that DNA persistence length strongly depends on temperature and accounting for this dependence is important in quantitative comparison between experimental results obtained at different temperatures.},

@article{Miyoshi2006,
abstract = {The effect of molecular crowding on the structure and stability of biomolecules has become a subject of increasing interest because it can clarify how biomolecules behave under cell-mimicking conditions. Here, we quantitatively analyzed the effects of molecular crowding on the thermodynamics of antiparallel G-quadruplex formation via Hoogsteen base pairs and of antiparallel hairpin-looped duplex (HP duplex) formation via Watson-Crick base pairs. The free energy change at 25 degrees C for G-quadruplex formation decreased from -3.5 to -5.5 kcal mol(-1) when the concentration of poly(ethylene glycol) 200 was increased from 0 to 40 wt \%, whereas that of duplex formation increased from -9.8 to -6.9 kcal mol(-1). These results showed that the antiparallel G-quadruplex is stabilized under molecular crowding conditions, but that the HP duplex is destabilized. Moreover, plots of stability (ln K(obs)) of the DNA structures versus water activity (ln a(w)) demonstrated that the ln K(obs) for G-quadruplex formation decreased linearly as the ln a(w) increased, whereas that for duplex formation increased linearly with the increase in ln a(w), suggesting that the slope approximately equals the number of water molecules released or taken up during the formation of these structures. Thus, molecular crowding affects the thermodynamics of DNA structure formation by altering the hydration of the DNA. The stabilization of the DNA structures with Hoogsteen base pairs and destabilization of DNA structures with Watson-Crick base pairs under molecular crowding conditions lead to structural polymorphism of DNA sequences regulated by the state of hydration.},

abstract = {The effect of monovalent cations on the thermal stability of a small model DNA hairpin has been measured by capillary electrophoresis, using an oligomer with 16 thymine residues as an unstructured control. The melting temperature of the model hairpin increases approximately linearly with the logarithm of increasing cation concentration in solutions containing Na(+), K(+), Li(+), NH(4)(+), Tris(+), tetramethylammonium (TMA(+)), or tetraethylammonium (TEA(+)) ions, is approximately independent of cation concentration in solutions containing tetrapropylammonium (TPA(+)) ions, and decreases with the logarithm of increasing cation concentration in solutions containing tetrabutylammonium (TBA(+)) ions. At constant cation concentration, the melting temperature of the DNA model hairpin decreases in the order Li(+) ∼ Na(+) ∼ K(+) > NH(4)(+) > TMA(+) > Tris(+) > TEA(+) > TPA(+) > TBA(+). Isothermal studies indicate that the decrease in the hairpin melting temperature with increasing cation hydrophobicity is not due to saturable, site-specific binding of the cation to the random coil conformation, but to the concomitant increase in cation size with increasing hydrophobicity. Larger cations are less effective at shielding the charged phosphate residues in B-form DNA because they cannot approach the DNA backbone as closely as smaller cations. By contrast, larger cations are relatively more effective at shielding the phosphate charges in the random coil conformation, where the phosphate-phosphate distance more closely matches cation size. Hydrophobic interactions between alkylammonium ions interacting electrostatically with the phosphate residues in the coil may amplify the effect of cation size on DNA thermal stability.},

abstract = {Single-molecule FRET experiments on freely diffusing rigid molecules frequently show FRET efficiency (E) distributions broader than those defined by photon statistics. It is often unclear whether the observed extra broadening can be attributed to a physical donor-acceptor distance (RDA) distribution. Using double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) labeled with Alexa488 and Cy5 (or Alexa647) as a test system, we investigate various possible contributions to the E distribution width. On the basis of simultaneous analysis of donor and acceptor intensities and donor lifetimes, we conclude that dsDNA chain dynamics can be ruled out as a possible reason for the observed E distribution broadening. We applied a set of tools to demonstrate that complex acceptor dye photophysics can represent a major contribution to the E distribution width. Quantitative analysis of the correlation between FRET efficiency and donor fluorescence lifetime in 2D multiparameter histograms allows one to distinguish between broadening due to distinct FRET or dye species. Moreover, we derived a simple theory, which predicts that the apparent distance width due to acceptor fluorescence quantum yield variations increases linearly with physical donor-acceptor distance. This theory nicely explains the experimentally observed FRET broadening of a series of freely diffusing labeled dsDNA and dsRNA molecules. Accounting for multiple acceptor states allowed the fitting of experimental E distributions, assuming a single fixed donor-acceptor distance.},

abstract = {The application of single-molecule fluorescence techniques to complex biological systems places demands on the performance of single fluorophores. We present an enzymatic oxygen scavenging system for improved dye stability in single-molecule experiments. We compared the previously described protocatechuic acid/protocatechuate-3,4-dioxygenase system to the currently employed glucose oxidase/catalase system. Under standardized conditions, we observed lower dissolved oxygen concentrations with the protocatechuic acid/protocatechuate-3,4-dioxygenase system. Furthermore, we observed increased initial lifetimes of single Cy3, Cy5, and Alexa488 fluorophores. We further tested the effects of chemical additives in this system. We found that biological reducing agents increase both the frequency and duration of blinking events of Cy5, an effect that scales with reducing potential. We observed increased stability of Cy3 and Alexa488 in the presence of the antioxidants ascorbic acid and n-propyl gallate. This new O(2)-scavenging system should have wide application for single-molecule fluorescence experiments.},

abstract = {Are judicial rulings based solely on laws and facts? Legal formalism holds that judges apply legal reasons to the facts of a case in a rational, mechanical, and deliberative manner. In contrast, legal realists argue that the rational application of legal reasons does not sufficiently explain the decisions of judges and that psychological, political, and social factors influence judicial rulings. We test the common caricature of realism that justice is "what the judge ate for breakfast" in sequential parole decisions made by experienced judges. We record the judges' two daily food breaks, which result in segmenting the deliberations of the day into three distinct "decision sessions." We find that the percentage of favorable rulings drops gradually from ≈ 65\% to nearly zero within each decision session and returns abruptly to ≈ 65\% after a break. Our findings suggest that judicial rulings can be swayed by extraneous variables that should have no bearing on legal decisions.},

abstract = {The supercoiling free energy of pUC19 DNA [2686 base pairs (bp)] was measured in various concentrations of PEG 8000 (polyethylene glycol; molecular weight 8000) by the topoisomer distribution method. The effective twist energy parameter (E(T)) that governs the supercoiling free energy declined linearly by 1.9-fold with increasing w/v \% PEG from 0 to 7.5\%, which lies below the threshold for intermolecular condensation. In principle, PEG could affect E(T) either via an osmotic exclusion mechanism or by altering the torsion elastic constant, bending rigidity, or self-repulsions of the DNA. Possible alterations of the DNA secondary structure and torsion elastic constant were assessed by CD spectroscopy and time-resolved fluorescence polarization anisotropy of intercalated ethidium. Up to 7.5\% PEG, the secondary structure of the DNA remained largely unaltered, as evidenced by (1) the absence of any significant change in the CD spectrum, (2) an extremely small relative decrease (-0.0013) in intrinsic twist, and (3) a negligibly small change in the torsion elastic constant. The observed reduction in E(T) cannot be ascribed primarily to a decrease in torsion elastic constant, and most likely does not stem from a decrease in bending rigidity either. The decrease in medium dielectric constant due to PEG should increase the self-repulsions, and thereby increase E(T), which is opposite to the observed trend. Instead, the observed decline in E(T) is attributed to an osmotic exclusion mechanism. The change in molar volume excluded to the PEG (Delta V(ex)), when the linking difference converts from Delta l = 0 to Delta l = +/-1, was determined from the observed E(T) value and PEG osmotic pressure at each concentration. The experimental Delta V(ex) values agree well with theoretical estimates reckoned for a simple osmotic exclusion model, in which PEG is excluded by hard-core interactions from a concentric cylindrical volume around every duplex segment. The difference in volume excluded to PEG between the Delta l = 0 and the Delta l = +/-1 topoisomers is attributed entirely to the approximately 0.7 additional writhe "crossing" of two duplex strands at roughly 90 degrees, which is known to occur in the latter species. When the separation between the duplex centers at the "crossing" was adjusted so that the theoretical estimate of Delta V(ex) matched the experimental value at each PEG concentration, a value near 5.7 nm was obtained in each case. The invariance and plausible magnitude of this mean separation at the crossing provide strong support for this simple osmotic exclusion model. An alternative model, in which the PEG is excluded from the entire coil envelope of the DNA out to its radius of gyration, perhaps because it decreases the local dielectric constant, was also considered. The estimated difference in excluded volume in that case exceeds the experimental value by a factor of nearly 10(4), and could be ruled out on that basis.},

abstract = {Cyanine dyes are widely used to study the folding and structural transformations of nucleic acids using fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET). The extent to which FRET can be used to extract inter- and intra-molecular distances has been the subject of considerable debate in the literature; the contribution of dye and linker dynamics to the observed FRET signal is particularly troublesome. We used molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to study the dynamics of the indocarbocyanine dyes Cy3 and Cy5 attached variously to the 3 or 5 terminal bases of a 16 base-pair RNA duplex. We then used Monte Carlo modeling of dye photophysics to predict the results of single-molecule sensitive FRET measurements of these same molecules. Our results show that the average value of FRET depends on both the terminal base and on the linker position. In particular, 3 attached dyes typically explore a wide region of configuration space and the relative orientation factor, $\kappa$ 2 , has a distribution that approaches that of free-rotators. This is in contrast to 5 attached dyes, which spend a significant fraction of their time in one or more configurations that are effectively stacked on the ends of the RNA duplex. The presence of distinct dye configurations for 5 attached dyes is consistent with observations made by others of multiple fluorescence lifetimes of Cy3 on nucleic acids. While FRET is frequently used as a molecular “ruler” to measure intramolecular distances, the unambiguous measurement of distances typically relies on the assumption that the rotational degrees of freedom of the dyes can be averaged out, and that the donor lifetime in the absence of the acceptor is a constant. We demonstrate that even for the relatively free 3 attached dyes, the correlation time of $\kappa$ 2 is still too long to justify the use of a free-rotation approximation. We further explore the consequences of multiple donor lifetimes on the predicted value of FRET.},

abstract = {Histograms of single-molecule F\"{o}rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) efficiency are often used to study the structures of biomolecules and relate these structures to function. Methods like probability distribution analysis analyze FRET histograms to detect heterogeneities in molecular structure, but they cannot determine whether this heterogeneity arises from dynamic processes or from the coexistence of several static structures. To this end, we introduce burst variance analysis (BVA), a method that detects dynamics by comparing the standard deviation of FRET from individual molecules over time to that expected from theory. Both simulations and experiments on DNA hairpins show that BVA can distinguish between static and dynamic sources of heterogeneity in single-molecule FRET histograms and can test models of dynamics against the observed standard deviation information. Using BVA, we analyzed the fingers-closing transition in the Klenow fragment of Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I and identified substantial dynamics in polymerase complexes formed prior to nucleotide incorporation; these dynamics may be important for the fidelity of DNA synthesis. We expect BVA to be broadly applicable to single-molecule FRET studies of molecular structure and to complement approaches such as probability distribution analysis and fluorescence correlation spectroscopy in studying molecular dynamics.},

abstract = {Fluorescence fluctuation spectroscopy utilizes the signal fluctuations of single molecules for studying biological processes. Information about the biological system is extracted from the raw data by statistical methods such as used in fluctuation correlation spectroscopy or photon counting histogram (PCH) analysis. Since detectors are never ideal, it is crucial to understand the influence of photodetectors on signal statistics to correctly interpret the experimental data. Here we focus on the effects of afterpulsing and detector dead-time on PCH statistics. We determine the dead-time and afterpulse probability for our detectors experimentally and show that afterpulsing can be neglected for most experiments. Dead-time effects on the PCH are concentration-dependent and become significant when more than one molecule is present in the excitation volume. We develop a new PCH theory that includes dead-time effects and verify it experimentally. Additionally, we derive a simple analytical expression that accurately predicts the effect of dead-time on the molecular brightness. Corrections for non-ideal detector effects extend the useful concentration range of PCH experiments and are crucial for the interpretation of titration and dilution experiments.},

abstract = {The worm-like chain model has often been employed to describe the average conformation of long, intrinsically straight polymer molecules, including DNA. The present study extends the applicability of the worm-like chain model to polymers containing bends or sections of different flexibility. Several cases have been explicitly considered: (i) polymers with a single bend; (ii) polymers with multiple coplanar bends; (iii) polymers with two non-coplanar bends; and (iv) polymers comprised of sections with different persistence lengths. Expressions describing the average conformation of such polymers in terms of the mean-square end-to-end distance have been derived for each case. For cases (i) and (iv), expressions for the projection of the end-to-end vector onto the initial orientation of the chain are presented. The expressions derived here have been used to investigate DNA molecules with sequence-induced bending (A-tracts). Mean-square end-to-end distance values determined from a large number of A-tract containing DNA molecules visualized by scanning force microscopy resulted in an average bend angle of 13.5 degrees per A-tract. A similar study was performed to characterize the flexibility of double-strandedDNA molecules containing a single-stranded region. Analysis of their mean-square end-to-end distance yielded a persistence length of 1.3 nm for single-stranded DNA.},

abstract = {Gene-regulatory complexes often require that pairs of DNA-bound proteins interact by looping-out short (often approximately 100-bp) stretches of DNA. The loops can vary in detailed length and sequence and, thus, in total helical twist, which radically alters their geometry. How this variability is accommodated structurally is not known. Here we show that the inherent twistability of 89- to 105-bp DNA circles exceeds theoretical expectation by up to 400-fold. These results can be explained only by greatly enhanced DNA flexibility, not by permanent bends. They invalidate the use of classic theories of flexibility for understanding sharp DNA looping but support predictions of two recent theories. Our findings imply an active role for DNA flexibility in loop formation and suggest that variability in the detailed helical twist of regulatory loops is accommodated naturally by the inherent twistability of the DNA.},

The strong dependence of transfer efficiency on probe separation makes FRET perfectly suited for "on/off" experiments. To use FRET to obtain quantitative distances and three-dimensional structures, however, is more challenging.

abstract = {Electronic excitation energy transfer has been studied by single molecule spectroscopy in donor/acceptor dyads composed of a perylenediimide donor and a terrylenediimide acceptor linked by oligo(phenylene) bridges of two different lengths. For the shorter bridge (three phenylene units) energy is transferred almost quantitatively from the donor to the acceptor, while for the longer bridge (seven phenylene units) energy transfer is less efficient as indicated by the occurrence of donor and acceptor emission. To determine energy transfer rates and efficiencies at the single molecule level, several methods have been employed. These comprise time-correlated single photon counting techniques at room temperature and optical linewidth measurements at low temperature (1.4 K). For both types of measurement we obtain broad distributions of the rate constants of energy transfer. These distributions are simulated in the framework of Forster theory by properly taking into account static disorder and the flexibility of the dyads, as both effects can substantially contribute to the distributions of energy transfer times. The rate constants of energy transfer obtained from the calculated distributions are smaller on average than those extracted from the experimental distributions, whereby the discrepancy is larger for the shorter bridge. Furthermore, by plotting the experimentally determined transfer rates against the individual spectral overlaps, approximately linear dependencies are found being indicative of a Forster-type contribution to the energy transfer. For a given single molecule such a linear dependence could be followed by spectral diffusion induced fluctuations of the spectral overlap. The discrepancies between measured energy transfer rates and rates calculated by Forster theory are briefly discussed in light of recent results of quantum chemical calculations, which indicate that a bridge-mediated contribution is mainly responsible for the deviations from Forster theory. The availability of the inhomogeneous distributions of donor and acceptor electronic transition frequencies allows for comparing the energy transfer process at liquid helium and room temperature for the same set of molecules via simple simulations. It is found that on average the energy transfer is by a factor of approximately 3 faster at room temperature, which is due to an increase of spectral overlap.},

abstract = {Results of the steady-state fluorescence, anisotropy and FRET measurements of G-quadruplex formation in the presence of selected cations (Li(+), Na(+), K(+), NEt(4)(+) and Mg(2+)) are reported. Three different fluorescent oligonucleotides with human telomeric sequence labeled with fluorescein (FAM) and tetramethylrhodamine (TAMRA) were investigated: a dual-labeled 21-mer denoted as PSO (Potassium Sensing Oligonucleotide) and two 5'- and 3'- single-labeled probes, FAM-21 and 21-TAMRA, respectively. The fluorescence signal of FAM-21 increased significantly for all systems and the fluorescence enhancement was comparable in magnitude for monovalent cations but it was more pronounced for Mg(2+) cation. This phenomenon was attributed to the protolytic equilibria of FAM affected by the variation in ionic strength. On the other hand, fluorescence of TAMRA was enhanced selectively by Na(I) cation that was explained by the dequenching of TAMRA emission originated from the peculiarity of the basket-type structure of Na(I)-quadruplex. Anisotropy of FAM-21 (but not 21-TAMRA) appeared to be sensitive to the G-quadruplex formation, showing significant increase with an increase in cation concentration and indicating some restrictions in rotational depolarization of FAM. FRET experiments revealed that all tested cations caused quenching of FAM fluorescence in PSO, but only Na(+) and K(+) ions produced sensitized emission of TAMRA acceptor. Higher FRET efficiency observed in the presence of sodium ion was attributed to the specific spectral factor and steric interactions in the basket-type Na(I)-quadruplex.},

abstract = {The sulfoindocyanine Cy3 is one of the most commonly used fluorescent dyes in the investigation of the structure and dynamics of nucleic acids by means of fluorescence methods. In this work, we report the fluorescence and photophysical properties of Cy3 attached covalently to single-stranded and duplex DNA. Steady-state and time-resolved fluorescence techniques were used to determine fluorescence quantum yields, emission lifetimes, and fluorescence anisotropy decays. The existence of a transient photoisomer was investigated by means of transient absorption techniques. The fluorescence quantum yield of Cy3 is highest when attached to the 5' terminus of single-stranded DNA (Cy3-5' ssDNA), and decreases by a factor of 2.4 when the complementary strand is annealed to form duplex DNA (Cy3-5' dsDNA). Substantial differences were also observed between the 5'-modified strands and strands modified through an internal amino-modified deoxy uridine. The fluorescence decay of Cy3 became multiexponential upon conjugation to DNA. The longest lifetime was observed for Cy3-5' ssDNA, where about 50\% of the decay is dominated by a 2.0-ns lifetime. This value is more than 10 times larger than the fluorescence lifetime of the free dye in solution. These observations are interpreted in terms of a model where the molecule undergoes a trans-cis isomerization reaction from the first excited state. We observed that the activation energy for photoisomerization depends strongly on the microenvironment in which the dye is located. The unusually high activation energy measured for Cy3-5' ssDNA is an indication of dye-ssDNA interactions. In fact, the time-resolved fluorescence anisotropy decay of this sample is dominated by a 2.5-ns rotational correlation time, which evidences the lack of rotational freedom of the dye around the linker that separates it from the terminal 5' phosphate. The remarkable variations in the photophysical properties of Cy3-DNA constructs demonstrate that caution should be used when Cy3 is used in studies employing DNA conjugates.},

abstract = {We used selective acylation of 2'-amine-substituted nucleotides to visualize local backbone conformations that occur preferentially at bulged sites in DNA duplexes. 2'-Amine acylation reports local nucleotide flexibility because unconstrained 2'-amino nucleotides more readily reach a reactive conformation in which the amide-forming transition state is stabilized by interactions between the amine nucleophile and the adjacent 3'-phosphodiester group. Bulged 2'-amine-substituted cytidine nucleotides react approximately 20-fold more rapidly than nucleotides constrained by base-pairing at 35 degrees C. In contrast, base-paired 2'-amine-substituted nucleotides flanked by a 5' or 3' bulge react two- or six-fold more rapidly, respectively, than the perfectly paired duplex. The relative lack of 2'-amine reactivity for nucleotides adjacent to a DNA bulge emphasizes, first, that structural perturbations do not extend significantly into the flanking duplex structure. Second, the exquisite sensitivity towards very local perturbations in nucleic acid structure suggests that 2'-amine acylation can be used to chemically interrogate deletion mutations in DNA. Finally, these data support the mechanical interpretation that the reactive ribose conformation for 2'-amine acylation requires that the base lies out of the helix and in the major groove, a mechanistic insight useful for designing 2'-amine-based sensors.},

abstract = {The insulin linked polymorphism region (ILPR) is known to regulate transcription of the gene coding for insulin. The ILPR has guanine rich segments, suggesting that G quadruplexes may be responsible for this regulatory role. Using mechanical unfolding in a laser tweezers instrument and circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy, we provide compelling evidence that highly stable parallel and antiparallel G quadruplex structures coexist in the predominant ILPR sequence of (ACAGGGGTGTGGGG)(2) at a physiologically relevant concentration of 100 mM KCl. Experiments at the single molecular level have shown that unfolding forces for parallel and antiparallel structures (F(unfold): 22.6 vs 36.9 pN, respectively) are higher than the stall forces of enzymes having helicase activities. From a mechanical perspective alone, these data support the hypothesis that G quadruplexes may cause replication slippage by blocking replication process. Using the unique combination of the rupture force and the contour length measured by laser tweezers, the simultaneous determination of probable parallel and antiparallel G quadruplex structures in a solution mixture has been achieved. Jarzynski's equality analysis has revealed that the antiparallel G quadruplex is thermodynamically more stable than the parallel conformer (DeltaG (unfold): 23 vs 14 kcal/mol, respectively). On the other hand, kinetic measurements have indicated that both parallel and antiparallel structures fold rather rapidly (k(fold): 0.4 vs 0.3 s(-1), respectively), suggesting that they may be kinetically accessible for gene control. This work provides an unprecedented mechanical perspective on G quadruplex stability, presenting a unique opportunity to predict the functional consequence when motor enzymes encounter such structures.},

abstract = {Unstructured proteins, RNA or DNA components provide functionally important flexibility that is key to many macromolecular assemblies throughout cell biology. As objective, quantitative experimental measures of flexibility and disorder in solution are limited, small angle scattering (SAS), and in particular small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), provides a critical technology to assess macromolecular flexibility as well as shape and assembly. Here, we consider the Porod-Debye law as a powerful tool for detecting biopolymer flexibility in SAS experiments. We show that the Porod-Debye region fundamentally describes the nature of the scattering intensity decay by capturing the information needed for distinguishing between folded and flexible particles. Particularly for comparative SAS experiments, application of the law, as described here, can distinguish between discrete conformational changes and localized flexibility relevant to molecular recognition and interaction networks. This approach aids insightful analyses of fully and partly flexible macromolecules that is more robust and conclusive than traditional Kratky analyses. Furthermore, we demonstrate for prototypic SAXS data that the ability to calculate particle density by the Porod-Debye criteria, as shown here, provides an objective quality assurance parameter that may prove of general use for SAXS modeling and validation.},

abstract = {The encapsulation of proteins and nucleic acids within the nanoscale water core of reverse micelles has been used for over 3 decades as a vehicle for a wide range of investigations including enzymology, the physical chemistry of confined spaces, protein and nucleic acid structural biology, and drug development and delivery. Unfortunately, the static and dynamical aspects of the distribution of water in solutions of reverse micelles complicate the measurement and interpretation of fundamental parameters such as pH. This is a severe disadvantage in the context of (bio)chemical reactions and protein structure and function, which are generally highly sensitive to pH. There is a need to more fully characterize and control the effective pH of the reverse micelle water core. The buffering effect of titratable head groups of the reverse micelle surfactants is found to often be the dominant variable defining the pH of the water core. Methods for measuring the pH of the reverse micelle aqueous interior using one-dimensional (1)H and two-dimensional heteronuclear NMR spectroscopy are described. Strategies for setting the effective pH of the reverse micelle water core are demonstrated. The exquisite sensitivity of encapsulated proteins to the surfactant, water content, and pH of the reverse micelle is also addressed. These results highlight the importance of assessing the structural fidelity of the encapsulated protein using multidimensional NMR before embarking upon a detailed structural and biophysical characterization.},

abstract = {Almost all biochemical reactions in vitro have been investigated through numerous experiments conducted in dilute solutions containing low concentrations of solutes. However, biomacromolecules such as nucleic acids, proteins, and polysaccharides are designed to function and/or form their native structures in a living cell containing high concentrations of biomacromolecules, substrates, cofactors, salts, and so on. In the present study, we have demonstrated quantitatively the effect of molecular crowding on structures and stabilities of the G-quadruplex of d(G(4)T(4)G(4)). Molecular crowding with poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) induced a structural transition from the antiparallel to the parallel G-quadruplex of d(G(4)T(4)G(4)), while molecular crowding with polycations did not alter the structure of the antiparallel G-quadruplex. The binding constants of putrescine, one of the polycations, for d(G(4)T(4)G(4)) in the absence and presence of Na(+) are calculated to be 277 and 2.5 M(-)(1), respectively. This indicates that the polycations coordinate to d(G(4)T(4)G(4)) with electrostatic interactions. The thermodynamic parameters of the antiparallel G-quadruplex formation under the crowding and noncrowding conditions induced by putrescine were also estimated. The stability of the antiparallel G-quadruplex decreased (-DeltaG degrees (25) decreased from 28 to 22 kcal mol(-)(1)) with molecular crowding by putrescine. Also, enthalpy and entropy changes in the structural formation under crowding and noncrowding conditions clearly showed that destabilization was entropy-driven.

@article{Nadeau1989,
abstract = {We report proton NMR studies on DNA oligonucleotides that contain A tracts of lengths known to produce various degrees of bending. Spectra of duplexes in the series 5'-(GGCAnCGG).(CCGTnGCC) (n = 3, 4, 5, 7, 9) reveal substantial structural changes within the An.Tn tract as its length is increased. Chemical-shift comparisons show that A tracts with fewer than about seven members do not contain regions of uniform [or poly(dA).poly(dT)-like] structure. Long An tracts (n greater than or equal to 7) appear to consist of an internal segment of homopolymeric conformation flanked by regions of transitional structure that occupy about four A.T pairs on the 5' side and two A.T pairs perhaps the directly adjacent G.C pair on the 3' side. In shorter duplexes (n less than 7), these two transitional regions overlap and an apparent mutual incompatibility causes length-dependent changes that are most pronounced near the 3' end. Throughout the series, there is a striking monotonic relationship between the location of an A.T pair in the A tract and the relative position of its ThyH3 resonance. The direction of the chemical-shift dispersion is opposite to that expected from consideration of ring-current effects alone; this discrepancy suggests a gradual decrease in ThyH3...N1Ade hydrogen-bond length as one moves from the 5' to the 3' end of the A tract and from short to long A tracts. Nuclear Overhauser effect measurements reveal that the interproton distances AdeH2...H1'Ade and AdeH2...H1'Thy vary along each A tract, except in the central regions of the longer ones where they are fairly constant and in good agreement with the poly(dA).poly(dT) structure proposed by Lipanov, A.A. \& Chuprina, V. P. [(1987) Nucleic Acids Res. 15, 5833-5844]. This model features a substantial negative base-pair tilt, which has been suggested previously as the source of A-tract bending. In contrast, the nuclear Overhauser effect distances are inconsistent with at least one known crystallographic A-tract structure [DiGabriele, A. D., Sanderson, M. R. \& Steitz, T. A. (1989) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 86, 1816-1820], which lacks appreciable base-pair tilt.},

abstract = {Results of an extensive Monte Carlo (MC) study on both single and many semiflexible charged chains with excluded volume (EV) are summarized. The model employed has been tailored to mimic wormlike micelles in solution. Simulations have been performed at different ionic strengths of added salt, charge densities, chain lengths and volume fractions , covering the dilute to concentrated regime. At infinite dilution the scattering functions can be fitted by the same fitting functions as for uncharged semiflexible chains with EV, provided that an electrostatic contribution bel is added to the bare Kuhn length. Thescaling of bel is found to be more complex than the Odijk–Skolnick– Fixman predictions, and qualitatively compatible with more recent variational calculations. Universality in the scaling of the radius of gyration is found if all lengths are rescaled by the total Kuhn length. At finite concentrations, the simple model used is able to reproduce the structural peak in the scattering function S(q) observed in many experiments, as well as other properties of polyelectrolytes (PELs) in solution. Universal behaviour of the forward scattering S(0) is established after a rescaling of . MC data are found to be in very good agreement with experimental scattering measurements with equilibrium PELs, which are giant wormlike micelles formed in mixtures of nonionic and ionic surfactants in dilute aqueous solution, with added salt.},

abstract = {The fluorescence lifetime technique offers an effective way to resolve fluorescent components with overlapping emission spectra. The presence of multiple fluorescent components in biological compounds can hamper their discrimination. The conventional method based on the nonlinear least-squares technique is unable to consistently determine the correct number of fluorescent components in a fluorescence decay profile. This can limit the applications of the fluorescence lifetime technique in biological assays and diagnoses where more than one fluorescent component is typically encountered. We describe the use of an expectation-maximization (EM) method with joint deconvolution to estimate the fluorescence decay parameters, and the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) to accurately determine the number of fluorescent components. A comprehensive simulation and experimental study is carried out to compare the performance and accuracy of the proposed method. The results show that the EM-BIC method is able to accurately identify the correct number of fluorescent components in samples with weakly fluorescing components.},

@article{Wahl07,
abstract = {Time-correlated single photon counting is a powerful method for sensitive time-resolved fluorescence measurements down to the single molecule level. The method is based on the precisely timed registration of single photons of a fluorescence signal. Historically, its primary goal was the determination of fluorescence lifetimes upon optical excitation by a short light pulse. This goal is still important today and therefore has a strong influence on instrument design. However, modifications and extensions of the early designs allow for the recovery of much more information from the detected photons and enable entirely new applications. Here, we present a new instrument that captures single photon events on multiple synchronized channels with picosecond resolution and over virtually unlimited time spans. This is achieved by means of crystal-locked time digitizers with high resolution and very short dead time. Subsequent event processing in programmable logic permits classical histogramming as well as time tagging of individual photons and their streaming to the host computer. Through the latter, any algorithms and methods for the analysis of fluorescence dynamics can be implemented either in real time or offline. Instrument test results from single molecule applications will be presented.},

abstract = {Recent measurements of the distribution of end-to-end distance in short DNA molecules infer cooperative stretching fluctuations. The assumptions underlying the analysis can be questioned if transient, thermally induced defects producing a localized decrease in bending stiffness are present in thermal equilibrium, such as regions in which DNA melts locally (bubbles), sustains large-angle bends (kinks), or can locally transform into an alternative (S-DNA) state. We study a generalized discrete worm-like chain model for DNA, capable of describing these experiments, showing that the model yields accurate fits to available experimental data. Our results indicate that DNA bending arising from such localized defects, rather than solely stretching, can be an equal contributor to end-to-end distance fluctuations for 35-bp DNA and contributes nontrivially to such fluctuations at all scales below the persistence length. The analysis suggests that such fluctuations should exhibit a scale-dependent cooperativity, specifically relevant in determining the behavior of short chains, but which saturates rapidly to a length-independent value for longer DNA, to ensure a consistent physical description of DNA across multiple scales. Our approach provides a minimal, yet accurate, coarse-grained description of DNA at the subpersistence length scales of current experimental interest.},

abstract = {The classical view of DNA posits that DNA must be stiff below the persistence length [<150 base pairs (bp)], but recent studies addressing this have yielded contradictory results. We developed a fluorescence-based, protein-free assay for studying the cyclization of single DNA molecules in real time. The assay samples the equilibrium population of a sharply bent, transient species that is entirely suppressed in single-molecule mechanical measurements and is biologically more relevant than the annealed species sampled in the traditional ligase-based assay. The looping rate has a weak length dependence between 67 and 106 bp that cannot be described by the worm-like chain model. Many biologically important protein-DNA interactions that involve looping and bending of DNA below 100 bp likely use this intrinsic bendability of DNA.},

abstract = {The forces responsible for the formation and stabilization of secondary and higher-order nucleic acid structure can be more fully understood once the sequence-dependent properties (e.g. intrinsic rigidity, effective rise) of the component single-stranded species are well-defined. Knowledge of the conformations of the single-stranded polymers is also important for the development of better polyelectrolyte models for various structural or strand-dissociation reactions. However, there is at present little quantitative information regarding the sequence dependence of either rise or rigidity in single-stranded DNA or RNA polymers. To address this issue, we describe a form of transient electric birefringence (TEB) measurement in which the rotational decay times (taugap) of DNA molecules possessing central, single-stranded regions (gaps) are compared with the corresponding times (taudplx) for duplex control molecules of the same length (in nucleotides per strand) as the continuous strand in the "gapped duplex". For magnesium ion concentrations above 1-2 mM, the tau ratios ( identical withtaugap/taudplx) for the gapped duplexes reach plateau values, above which no further change in tau ratio is observed; values for the persistence length (P) and internucleotide spacing (h) of the gap sequences are obtained from the experimental tau ratios. For dTn, the permissible ranges of P and h are 20-30 A and 5-7 A per nucleotide (nt), respectively, with optimal values of 31 A (P) and 5. 2 A/nt (h). For dAn, the persistence length for the low temperature (4 degreesC), stacked form is 78 (+/-8) A for a helix rise of 3.2 A/nt. One significant advantage of the current method over previous approaches is the use of short (80-100 nt) molecules, thus facilitating the production of various gap sequences through synthetic means.},

abstract = {A two-sided model for DNA is employed to analyze fluctuations of the spatial distribution of condensed counterions and the effect of these fluctuations on transient bending. We analyze two classes of fluctuations. In the first, the number of condensed counterions on one side of the DNA remains at its average value, while on the other side, counterions are lost to bulk solution or gained from it. The second class of fluctuations is characterized by movement of some counterions from one side of the DNA to the other. The root-mean-square fluctuation for each class is calculated from counterion condensation theory. The amplitude of the root-mean-square fluctuation depends on the ionic strength as well as the length of the segment considered and is of the order 5-10\%. Both classes of fluctuation result in transient bends toward the side of greater counterion density. The bending amplitudes are approximately 15\% of the total root-mean-square bends associated with the persistence length of DNA. We are thus led to suggest that asymmetric fluctuations of counterion density contribute modestly but significantly toward the aggregate of thermalized solvent fluctuations that cause bending deformations of DNA free in solution. The calculations support the idea that counterions may exert some modulating influence on the fine structure of DNA.},

abstract = {Comparative gel electrophoresis measurements were used to characterize DNA bending in molecules containing an extra adenosine on one strand, the so-called bulge defect. We used oligomers containing A6 tracts separated from the bulged base by varying numbers of nucleotides to determine the direction and magnitude of the bulge bend. Helix unwinding by the bulge was determined from the electrophoretic anomaly as a function of the size of the repeated monomers. We conclude that the bulge bend is 21 degrees +/- 3 degrees, primarily in the direction of tilt away from the bulged base. The total helical advance of the DNA at the bulge site is smaller than would be the case if the complementary T were present, corresponding to an unwinding by 25 degrees +/- 6 degrees. These values are in good agreement with the results of NMR and energy minimization studies of the bulged base in double-helical deoxyoligonucleotides [Woodson, S. A., \& Crothers, D.M.

abstract = {F\"{o}rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) is a technique commonly used to unravel the structure and conformational changes of biomolecules being vital for all living organisms. Typically, FRET is performed using dyes attached externally to nucleic acids through a linker that complicates quantitative interpretation of experiments because of dye diffusion and reorientation. Here, we report a versatile, general methodology for the simulation and analysis of FRET in nucleic acids, and demonstrate its particular power for modelling FRET between probes possessing limited diffusional and rotational freedom, such as our recently developed nucleobase analogue FRET pairs (base-base FRET). These probes are positioned inside the DNA/RNA structures as a replacement for one of the natural bases, thus, providing unique control of their position and orientation and the advantage of reporting from inside sites of interest. In demonstration studies, not requiring molecular dynamics modelling, we obtain previously inaccessible insight into the orientation and nanosecond dynamics of the bases inside double-stranded DNA, and we reconstruct high resolution 3D structures of kinked DNA. The reported methodology is accompanied by a freely available software package, FRETmatrix, for the design and analysis of FRET in nucleic acid containing systems.},

abstract = {We systematically investigated the effects of loop length on the conformation, thermodynamic stability, and hydration of DNA G-quadruplexes under dilute and molecular crowding conditions in the presence of Na(+). Structural analysis showed that molecular crowding induced conformational switches of oligonucleotides with the longer guanine stretch and the shorter thymine loop. Thermodynamic parameters further demonstrated that the thermodynamic stability of G-quadruplexes increased by increasing the loop length from two to four, whereas it decreased by increasing the loop length from four to six. Interestingly, we found by osmotic pressure analysis that the number of water molecules released from the G-quadruplex decreased with increasing thermodynamic stability. We assumed that base-stacking interactions within the loops not only stabilized the whole G-quadruplex structure but also created hydration sites by accumulating nucleotide functional groups. The molecular crowding effects on the stability of G-quadruplexes composed of abasic sites, which reduce the stacking interactions at the loops, further demonstrated that G-quadruplexes with fewer stacking interactions within the loops released a larger number of water molecules upon folding. These results showed that the stacking interactions within the loops determined the thermodynamic stability and hydration of the whole G-quadruplex.},

@article{Bloomfield1997,
abstract = {In the presence of multivalent cations, high molecular weight DNA undergoes a dramatic condensation to a compact, usually highly ordered toroidal structure. This review begins with an overview of DNA condensation: condensing agents, morphology, kinetics, and reversibility, and the minimum size required to form orderly condensates. It then summarizes the statistical mechanics of the collapse of stiff polymers, which shows why DNA condensation is abrupt and why toroids are favored structures. Various ways to estimate or measure intermolecular forces in DNA condensation are discussed, all of them agreeing that the free energy change per base pair is very small, on the order of 1\% of thermal energy. Experimental evidence is surveyed showing that DNA condensation occurs when about 90\% of its charge is neutralized by counterions. The various intermolecular forces whose interplay gives rise to DNA condensation are then reviewed. The entropy loss upon collapse of the expanded wormlike coil costs free energy, and stiffness sets limits on tight curvature. However, the dominant contributions seem to come from ions and water. Electrostatic repulsions must be overcome by high salt concentrations or by the correlated fluctuations of territorially bound multivalent cations. Hydration must be adjusted to allow a cooperative accommodation of the water structure surrounding surface groups on the DNA helices as they approach. Undulations of the DNA in its confined surroundings extend the range of the electrostatic forces. The condensing ions may also subtly modify the local structure of the double helix.},

abstract = {Loss of telomeric DNA during cell proliferation may play a role in ageing and cancer. Since telomeres permit complete replication of eukaryotic chromosomes and protect their ends from recombination, we have measured telomere length, telomerase activity and chromosome rearrangements in human cells before and after transformation with SV40 or Ad5. In all mortal populations, telomeres shortened by approximately 65 bp/generation during the lifespan of the cultures. When transformed cells reached crisis, the length of the telomeric TTAGGG repeats was only approximately 1.5 kbp and many dicentric chromosomes were observed. In immortal cells, telomere length and frequency of dicentric chromosomes stabilized after crisis. Telomerase activity was not detectable in control or extended lifespan populations but was present in immortal populations. These results suggest that chromosomes with short (TTAGGG)n tracts are recombinogenic, critically shortened telomeres may be incompatible with cell proliferation and stabilization of telomere length by telomerase may be required for immortalization.},

abstract = {This article deals with the time interval measurement device, which is based on a surface acoustic wave (SAW) filter as a time interpolator. The operating principle is based on the fact that a transversal SAW filter excited by a short pulse can generate a finite signal with highly suppressed spectra outside a narrow frequency band. If the responses to two excitations are sampled at clock ticks, they can be precisely reconstructed from a finite number of samples and then compared so as to determine the time interval between the two excitations. We have designed and constructed a two-channel time interval measurement device which allows independent timing of two events and evaluation of the time interval between them. The device has been constructed using commercially available components. The experimental results proved the concept. We have assessed the single-shot time interval measurement precision of 1.3 ps rms that corresponds to the time of arrival precision of 0.9 ps rms in each channel. The temperature drift of the measured time interval on temperature is lower than 0.5 ps/K, and the long term stability is better than +/-0.2 ps/h. These are to our knowledge the best values reported for the time interval measurement device. The results are in good agreement with the error budget based on the theoretical analysis.},

abstract = {The structural basis of DNA curvature remains elusive, because models for curvature based on crystallographic structures of molecules containing A tracts do not agree with any of the models for sequence-directed curvature based on solution studies. Here we demonstrate that the difference is probably due to MPD (2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol), the dehydrating agent commonly used in crystallography. One characteristic signature of curved DNA molecules is that they run anomalously slowly on polyacrylamide gels, appearing to be larger than they actually are. The gel anomalies of three curved DNAs from trypanosome kinetoplast minicircles drop monotonically with increasing MPD concentration, indicating that MPD straightens molecules that are curved in aqueous solution. This is not due to some non-specific effect of MPD on poly(dA) or polypurine tracts, because control molecules containing dA70 and dG43 run normally over the full range of MPD concentrations. Circular dichroism spectra are not affected by MPD, ruling out a conformational change to a structure outside the B-DNA family. The effect is not due to MPD-induced changes in phasing of the curved sequences, because MPD has virtually no effect on the linking numbers of relaxed plasmids containing either curved sequences or dA70. At the concentrations of MPD used in X-ray crystallography, the curvature of DNAs containing A tracts is substantially lower than in solution, which probably explains the ongoing discrepancies between the crystallographic results and models based on solution studies.},

abstract = {We review the history of DNA mechanics and its analysis. We evaluate several methods to analyze the structures of superhelical DNA molecules, each predicated on the assumption that DNA can be modeled with reasonable accuracy as an extended, linearly elastic polymer. Three main approaches are considered: mechanical equilibrium methods, which seek to compute minimum energy conformations of topologically constrained molecules; statistical mechanical methods, which seek to compute the Boltzmann distribution of equilibrium conformations that arise in a finite temperature environment; and dynamic methods, which seek to compute deterministic trajectories of the helix axis by solving equations of motion. When these methods include forces of self-contact, which prevent strand passage and preserve the topological constraint, each predicts plectonemically interwound structures. On the other hand, the extent to which these mechanical methods reliably predict energetic and thermodynamic properties of superhelical molecules is limited, in part because of their inability to account explicitly for interactions involving solvent. Monte Carlo methods predict the entropy associated with supercoiling to be negative, in conflict with a body of experimental evidence that finds it is large and positive, as would be the case if superhelical deformations significantly disrupt the ordering of ambient solvent molecules. This suggests that the large-scale conformational properties predicted by elastomechanical models are not the only ones determining the energetics and thermodynamics of supercoiling. Moreover, because all such models that preserve the topological constraint correctly predict plectonemic interwinding, despite these and other limitations, this constraint evidently dominates energetic and thermodynamic factors in determining supercoil geometry. Therefore, agreement between predicted structures and structures obtained experimentally, for example, by electron microscopy, does not in itself provide evidence for the correctness or completeness of any given model of DNA mechanics.},

abstract = {Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) has been used to demonstrate the bending of DNA and RNA helices for three series of double-stranded molecules containing bulge loops of unopposed adenosine nucleotides (An, n = 0-9). Fluorescein and rhodamine were covalently attached to the 5' termini of the two component strands. Three different methods were applied to measure the FRET efficiencies. The extent of energy transfer within each series increases as the number of bulged nucleotides varies from 1 to 7, indicating a shortening of the end-to-end distance. This is consistent with a bending of DNA and RNA helices that is greater for larger bulges. The FRET efficiency for DNA molecules with A9 bulges is lower than the efficiency for the corresponding A7 bulged molecules, although the A9 molecules exhibit increased electrophoretic retardation. Ranges of bending angles can be estimated from the FRET results.},

abstract = {We characterized the effect of the first basepair on the conformational dynamics of the fluorescent dye Cy3 attached to the 5' end of double-stranded DNA using gaussian-mixture adaptive umbrella sampling simulations. In the simulations, the sampling of all five dihedral angles along the linker was enhanced, so that both stacked and unstacked states were sampled. The affinity of Cy3 for a T·A basepair (with the dye attached to T) was found to be significantly less than for the other basepairs. This was verified experimentally by measuring the activation energies for cis-trans isomerization of the dye. The simulation and experimental results indicate the existence of partially unstacked conformations amenable to photoisomerization. The simulations also showed that stacking of Cy3 straightens the DNA while stabilizing the first basepair. Our findings indicate that fluorescence is modulated by Cy3-DNA interactions in a sequence-dependent manner.},

abstract = {Local DNA deformation arises from an interplay among sequence-related base stacking, intrastrand phosphate repulsion, and counterion and water distribution, which is further complicated by the approach and binding of a protein. The role of electrostatics in this complex chemistry was investigated using tethered cationic groups that mimic proximate side chains. A DNA duplex was modified with one or two centrally located deoxyuracils substituted at the 5-position with either a flexible 3-aminopropyl group or a rigid 3-aminopropyn-1-yl group. End-to-end helical distances and duplex flexibility were obtained from measurements of the time-resolved F\"{o}rster resonance energy transfer between 5'- and 3'-linked dye pairs. A novel analysis utilized the first and second moments of the G(t) function, which encompasses only the energy transfer process. Duplex flexibility is altered by the presence of even a single positive charge. In contrast, the mean 5'-3' distance is significantly altered by the introduction of two adjacently tethered cations into the double helix but not by a single cation: two adjacent aminopropyl groups decrease the 5'-3' distance while neighboring aminopropynyl groups lengthen the helix.},

@article{Narayanan2010,
abstract = {Fluorescent nucleic acid base analogues (FBAs) are used widely as probes of DNA and RNA structure and dynamics. Of increasing utility are the pteridone adenosine analogues (6MAP, DMAP) and pteridine guanosine analogues (3MI, 6MI). These FBAs (collectively referred to as PTERs) are useful, in part, because their fluorescence quantum yields, Phi(f), are modulated by base stacking with native bases (NBs), making them sensitive reporters of DNA structure. The quenching mechanism has been hypothesized to be photoinduced electron transfer following selective excitation of the FBA, but hard evidence for this has been lacking. The degree of quenching shows some dependence on the neighboring bases, but there has been no real determination as to whether FBA*:NB complexes satisfy the basic thermodynamic requirement for spontaneous PET: a negative free energy for the electron transfer reaction. Indeed, quenching may result from entirely different mechanisms. To address these questions, Stern-Volmer (S-V) experiments were performed using the native-base monophosphate nucleotides (NMPs) GMP, AMP, CMP, and dTMP in aqueous solutions as quenchers to obtain quenching rate constants, k(q). Cyclic voltammetry (CV) and optical absorption and emission data of the PTERS were obtained in aprotic organic solvents. These data were used to obtain excited-state redox potentials from which electron transfer free energies were derived using the Rehm-Weller equation. The reorganization energies for PET were obtained using the Scandola-Balzani equation, taking into account the free energy contribution due to water. 6MAP*, DMAP*, and 3MI* gave negative free energies between -0.1 and -0.2 eV and reorganization energies of about 0.13 eV. They all displayed ET activation energies below the accessible thermal energy (0.038 eV = 3/2k(B)T, where k(B) is Boltzmann's constant) for all NMPs with the exception of CMP, whose activation barrier was only about 35\% higher (approximately 0.05 eV). Thus, we conclude that these PTERs act as electron acceptors and promote NMP oxidation. However, 6MI* had positive ET free energies for all NMPs with the exception of GMP (and then only for nucleobase oxidation). The magnitudes of these free energies (> or = 0.45 eV for AMP, CMP, and dTMP) suggest that 6MI* may not quenched by PET.},

This result follows from a rigorous theory that takes many molecules into account. We consider the distributions of the number of photons (photon counting histograms) and show that multiple-molecule effects are pronounced at large photon counts even at low concentrations. FRET efficiency distributions reveal multiple-molecule effects at large threshold values. This might be misinterpreted as multiple conformational states. Multiple-molecule effects strongly depend on the brightness of fluorophores. A simple test is suggested to determine parameters for which the single-molecule description is applicable.},

abstract = {Fluorescence resonance energy transfer provides valuable long-range distance information about macromolecules in solution. Fluorescein and Cy3 are an important donor-acceptor pair of fluorophores; the characteristic F\"{o}rster length for this pair on DNA is 56 A, so the pair can be used to study relatively long distances. Measurement of FRET efficiency for a series of DNA duplexes terminally labeled with fluorescein and Cy3 suggests that the Cy3 is close to the helical axis of the DNA. An NMR analysis of a self-complementary DNA duplex 5'-labeled with Cy3 shows that the fluorophore is stacked onto the end of the helix, in a manner similar to that of an additional base pair. This provides a known point from which distances calculated from FRET measurements are measured. Using the FRET efficiencies for the series of DNA duplexes as restraints, we have determined an effective position for the fluorescein, which is maximally extended laterally from the helix. The knowledge of the fluorophore positions can now be used for more precise interpretation of FRET data from nucleic acids.},

In response to the widespread interest in SAXS reconstructions, their value in conjunction with such time-resolved data has been examined. The group I intron from Tetrahymena thermophila and its P4-P6 subdomain are ideal model systems for investigation owing to extensive previous studies, including crystal structures.

This approach makes use of an oligonucleotide probe or primer containing a BODIPY((R)) FL-modified cytosine at its 5'-end. When such a probe was hybridized with a target DNA, its fluorescence was quenched by the guanine in the target, complementary to the modified cytosine, and the quench rate was proportional to the amount of target DNA. This widely applicable technique will be used directly with larger samples or in conjunction with the polymerase chain reaction to quantify small DNA samples.},

We show that this behavior originates from the asymmetry of the molecular charge distribution which makes one end of the ions strongly hydrophobic while the other end is even more hydrophilic than the regular water (H2O) molecules. The effect is more pronounced for the hydroxide than for the hydronium. Our results are consistent with several experimental observations and explain why hydrophobic surfaces in contact with water acquire a net negative charge, a phenomenon that has important implications for biology and polymer science.},

abstract = {A common problem in detecting metal ions with fluorescentchemosensors is the emission-suppressing effects of fluorescence-quenching metal ions. This quenching tendency makes it difficult to design sensors with turn-on signal, and differentiate between several metal ions that may yield a strong quenching response. To address these challenges, we investigate a new sensor design strategy, incorporating fluorophores and metal ligands as DNA base replacements in DNA-like oligomers, for generating a broader range of responses for quenching metal ions. The modular molecular design enabled rapid synthesis and discovery of sensors from libraries on PEG-polystyrene beads. Using this approach, water-soluble sensors 1-5 were identified as strong responders to a set of eight typically quenching metal ions (Co(2+), Ni(2+), Cu(2+), Hg(2+), Pb(2+), Ag(+), Cr(3+), and Fe(3+)). They were synthesized and characterized for sensing responses in solution. Cross-screening with the full set of metal ions showed that they have a wide variety of responses, including emission enhancements and red- and blue-shifts. The diversity of sensor responses allows as few as two sensors (1 and 2) to be used together to successfully differentiate these eight metals. As a test, a set of unknown metal ion solutions in blind studies were also successfully identified based on the response pattern of the sensors. The modular nature of the sensor design strategy suggests a broadly applicable approach to finding sensors for differentiating many different cations by pattern-based recognition, simply by varying the sequence and composition of ligands and fluorophores on a DNA synthesizer.},

This new method uses a generalized likelihood ratio test that determines the location of an intensity change point based on individual photon arrival times. This test is applied recursively to an entire single molecule intensity trajectory, thus finding each change points. Expectation-maximization clustering and the Bayesian information criterion is then used for accurate determination of the true number of states accessible to the system. This procedure allows rigorous and quantitative determination of intensity change points without the artificial time resolution limitations that arise from binning and thresholding.},

abstract = {For many aspects of DNA-protein interaction, it is vital to know how DNA bending rigidity (or persistence length, a) depends on its sequence. We addressed this problem using the method based on cyclization of short DNA fragments, which allows very accurate determination of a. Our approach was based on assigning specific values of a to each of 10 distinct dinucleotide steps. We prepared DNA fragments, each about 200 bp in length, with various quasi-periodic sequences, measured their cyclization efficiencies (j factors), and fitted the data by the theoretical equation to obtain the values of a for each fragment. From these data, we obtained a set of a for the dinucleotide steps. To test this set, we used it to design DNA sequences that should correspond to very low and very high values of a, prepared the corresponding fragments, and determined their values of a experimentally. The measured and calculated values of a were very close to one another, confirming that we have found the correct solution to this long-standing problem. The same experimental data also allowed us to determine the sequence dependence of DNA helical repeat.},

abstract = {Compartmentalization of the cytoplasm by membranes should have a strong influence on the diffusion of macromolecules inside a cell, and we have studied how this could be reflected in fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) experiments. We derived the autocorrelation function measured by FCS for fluorescent particles diffusing close to a soft membrane, and show it to be the sum of two contributions: short timescale correlations come from the diffusion of the particles (differing from free diffusion because of the presence of an obstacle), whereas long timescale correlations arise from fluctuations of the membrane itself (which create intensity fluctuations by modulating the number of detected particles). In the case of thermal fluctuations this second type of correlation depends on the elasticity of the membrane. To illustrate this calculation, we report the results of FCS experiments carried out close to a vesicle membrane. The measured autocorrelation functions display very distinctly the two expected contributions, and allow both to recover the diffusion coefficient of the fluorophore and to characterize the membrane fluctuations in term of a bending rigidity. Our results show that FCS measurements inside cells can lead to erroneous values of the diffusion coefficient if the influence of membranes is not recognized.},

abstract = {Two general strategies are introduced to identify and quantify single molecules in dilute solutions by employing a spectroscopic method for data registration and specific burst analysis, denoted multiparameter fluorescence detection (MFD). MFD uses pulsed excitation and time-correlated single-photon counting to simultaneously monitor the evolution of the eight-dimensional fluorescence information (fundamental anisotropy, fluorescence lifetime, fluorescence intensity, time, excitation spectrum, fluorescence spectrum, fluorescence quantum yield, distance between fluorophores) in real time and allows for selection of specific events for subsequent analysis. Using the multiple fluorescence dimensions, we demonstrate a dye labeling scheme of oligonucleotides, by which it is possible to identify and separate 16 different compounds in the mixture via their characteristic pattern by MFD. Such identification procedures and multiplex assays with single-molecule sensitivity may have a great impact on screening of species and events that do not lend themselves so easily to amplification, such as disease-specific proteins and their interactions.},

abstract = {The standard deviation (SD) in fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) has been mostly neglected in applications. However, the knowledge of the correct SD is necessary for an accurate data evaluation, especially when fitting theoretical models to experimental data. In this work, an algorithm is presented that considers the essential features of FCS. It allows prediction of the performance of FCS measurements in various cases, which is important for finding optimal experimental conditions. The program calculates the SD of the experimental autocorrelation function online. This procedure leads to improved parameter estimation, compared to currently used theoretical approximations for the SD. Three methods for the calculation of the SD are presented and compared to earlier analytical solutions (D. E. Koppel. 1974. Phys. Rev. A. 10:1938-1945.), calculation directly from fluorescence intensity values, by averaging several FCS measurements, or by dividing one measurement into a set of shorter data packages. Although the averaging over several measurements yields accurate estimates for the SD, the other two methods are considerably less time consuming, can be run online, and yield comparable results.},

To elucidate the conformations of rotating F1, we measured fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) between a donor on one of the three betas and an acceptor on gamma in single F1 molecules. The yield of FRET changed stepwise at low ATP concentrations, reflecting the stepwise rotation of gamma. In the ATP-waiting state, the FRET yields indicated a gamma position approximately 40 degrees counterclockwise (= direction of rotation) from that in the crystal structures of mitochondrial F1, suggesting that the crystal structures mimic a metastable state before product release.},

In the presence of ethylene glycol (EG) and poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) (MW = 200-8000), the stability of the oligomer DNA duplexes with differing nucleotide length varied, depending on the nucleotide length as well as the size of PEG. It was also revealed that the decrease of water activity is the primary factor for destabilization of the short (8-mer) duplex by addition of high molecular weight PEGs as well as low molecular weight PEGs and other low molecular weight cosolutes. In addition, the number of water molecules taken up per base pair formation was the same for all the PEGs and for 1,2-dimethoxyethane, which was greater than in the cases of glycerol, EG, 1,3-propanediol, and 2-methoxyethanol, suggesting that the solvation of nucleotides may differ, depending on the cosolute structure. These findings are useful not only for understanding nucleic acid structures and functions in cells but also for the design of oligonucleotides applicable for cells, such as antisense nucleic acids, RNAi, and DNA chips.},

abstract = {The structure and flexibility of the RNA duplex has been studied using extended molecular dynamics simulations on four diverse 18-mer oligonucleotides designed to contain many copies of the 10 unique dinucleotide steps in different sequence environments. Simulations were performed using the two most popular force fields for nucleic acids simulations (AMBER and CHARMM) in their latest versions, trying to arrive to a consensus picture of the RNA flexibility. Contrary to what was found for DNA duplex (DNA(2)), no clear convergence is found for the RNA duplex (RNA(2)), but one of the force field seems to agree better with experimental data. MD simulations performed with this force field were used to fully characterize, for the first time to our knowledge, the sequence-dependent elastic properties of RNA duplexes at different levels of resolutions. The flexibility pattern of RNA(2) shows similarities with DNA(2), but also surprising differences, which help us to understand the different biological functions of both molecules. A full mesoscopic model of RNA duplex at different resolution levels is derived to be used for genome-wide description of the flexibility of double-helical fragments of RNA.},

abstract = {Dual-color fluorescence cross-correlation spectroscopy (dcFCCS) allows one to quantitatively assess the interactions of mobile molecules labeled with distinct fluorophores. The technique is widely applied to both reconstituted and live-cell biological systems. A major drawback of dcFCCS is the risk of an artifactual false-positive or overestimated cross-correlation amplitude arising from spectral cross-talk. Cross-talk can be reduced or prevented by fast alternating excitation, but the technology is not easily implemented in standard commercial setups. An experimental strategy is devised that does not require specialized hardware and software for recognizing and correcting for cross-talk in standard dcFCCS. The dependence of the cross-talk on particle concentrations and brightnesses is quantitatively confirmed. Moreover, it is straightforward to quantitatively correct for cross-talk using quickly accessible parameters, that is, the measured (apparent) fluorescence count rates and correlation amplitudes. Only the bleed-through ratio needs to be determined in a calibration measurement. Finally, the limitations of cross-talk correction and its influence on experimental error are explored.},

Therefore, an understanding of the effects of molecular crowding conditions on biomolecules is important to broad research fields such as biochemical, medical, and pharmaceutical sciences. In this review, we describe molecular conditions in the cytoplasm and nucleus, which are totally different from in vitro conditions, and then show the biochemical and biophysical consequences of molecular crowding. Finally, we discuss the effect of molecular crowding on the structure, stability, and function of nucleic acids and the significance of molecular crowding in biotechnology and nanotechnology.},

Moreover, particular genomic regions in a number of highly divergent organisms are enriched for such sequences, raising the possibility that G-quadruplexes form in vivo and affect cellular processes. While G-quadruplexes have been rigorously studied in vitro, whether these structures actually form in vivo and what their roles might be in the context of the cell have remained largely unanswered questions. Recent studies suggest that G-quadruplexes participate in the regulation of such varied processes as telomere maintenance, transcriptional regulation and ribosome biogenesis. Here we review studies aimed at elucidating the in vivo functions of quadruplex structures, with a particular focus on findings in yeast. In addition, we discuss the utility of yeast model systems in the study of the cellular roles of G-quadruplexes.},

@article{Perroud05,
abstract = {We have demonstrated that our photon counting histogram (PCH) model with the correction for one-photon excitation is valid at multiple bin times. The fitted apparent brightness and concentration follow the three-dimensional diffusion model. More importantly, the semi-empirical parameter, F, introduced in the PCH model for one-photon excitation to correct for the non-Gaussian shape of the observation volume, shows small variations with different bin times. These variations are consistent with the physical interpretation of F, and they do not affect the resolving power of the PCH model for one-photon excitation. Based on these findings, we extend the time-independent PCH analysis to time-dependent photon counting multiple histograms (PCMH). This model considers the effect of bin time on the PCH parameters in a way that is similar to fluorescence intensity multiple distribution analysis (FIMDA). From the same set of data, PCMH extracts time-dependent parameters (diffusion time and triplet-state relaxation time) as well as time-independent parameters (true specific brightness and true average number of molecules). Given a three- to fourfold experimental difference in molecular brightness, we find that PCMH can resolve each species in a two-species sample and extract their respective diffusion times even when fluorescence correlation spectroscopy cannot.},

abstract = {We have measured the bending elasticity of short double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) chains through small-angle x-ray scattering from solutions of dsDNA-linked dimers of gold nanoparticles. This method, which does not require exertion of external forces or binding to a substrate, reports on the equilibrium distribution of bending fluctuations, not just an average value (as in ensemble fluorescence resonance energy transfer) or an extreme value (as in cyclization), and in principle provides a more robust data set for assessing the suitability of theoretical models. Our experimental results for dsDNA comprising 42-94 basepairs are consistent with a simple wormlike chain model of dsDNA elasticity, whose behavior we have determined from Monte Carlo simulations that explicitly represent nanoparticles and their alkane tethers. A persistence length of 50 nm (150 basepairs) gave a favorable comparison, consistent with the results of single-molecule force-extension experiments on much longer dsDNA chains, but in contrast to recent suggestions of enhanced flexibility at these length scales.},

abstract = {The UNAFold software package is an integrated collection of programs that simulate folding, hybridization, and melting pathways for one or two single-stranded nucleic acid sequences. The name is derived from "Unified Nucleic Acid Folding." Folding (secondary structure) prediction for single-stranded RNA or DNA combines free energy minimization, partition function calculations and stochastic sampling. For melting simulations, the package computes entire melting profiles, not just melting temperatures. UV absorbance at 260 nm, heat capacity change (C(p)), and mole fractions of different molecular species are computed as a function of temperature. The package installs and runs on all Unix and Linux platforms that we have looked at, including Mac OS X. Images of secondary structures, hybridizations, and dot plots may be computed using common formats. Similarly, a variety of melting profile plots is created when appropriate. These latter plots include experimental results if they are provided. The package is "command line" driven. Underlying compiled programs may be used individually, or in special combinations through the use of a variety of Perl scripts. Users are encouraged to create their own scripts to supplement what comes with the package.

abstract = {Although the transition from the B-DNA double helix to the A-form is essential for biological function, as shown by the existence of the A-form in many protein-DNA complexes, the dynamics of this transition has not been resolved yet. According to molecular dynamics simulations the transition is expected in the time range of a few nanoseconds. The B-A transition induced by mixing of DNA samples with ethanol in stopped flow experiments is complete within the deadtime, showing that the reaction is faster than approximately 0.2 ms. The reaction was resolved by an electric field jump technique with induction of the transition by a dipole stretching force driving the A- to the B-form. Poly[d(A-T)] was established as a favourable model system, because of a particularly high cooperativity of the transition and because of a spectral signature allowing separation of potential side reactions. The time constants observed in the case of poly[d(A-T)] with approximately 1600 bp are in the range around 10 micros. An additional process with time constants of approximately 100 micros is probably due to nucleation. The same time constants (within experimental accuracy +/-10\%) were observed for a poly[d(A-T)] sample with approximately 70 bp. Under low salt conditions commonly used for studies of the B-A transition, the time constants are almost independent of the ionic strength. The experimental data show that a significant activation barrier exists in the B-A transition and that the helical states are clearly separated from each other, in contrast to predictions by molecular dynamics simulations.},

The thermodynamics and kinetics of DNA duplex formation in the presence of high concentration of glycerol, EG and PEG were investigated to discern nucleic acid behavior under molecular crowding condition. Comparing with the data obtained in the dilute solution, the melting temperature (T(m)) of a 10-mer DNA duplex (5'-TAGGTTATAA-3'/5'-TTATAACCTA-3') decreased by 4.8 degrees C, 5.6 degrees C, or 7.0 degrees C in the presence of 20 wt\% glycerol, EG, or PEG200, respectively. The kinetic results revealed that the destabilization was not only caused by decreasing the association rate constant but also caused by great increasing the dissociation rate constant. These results are useful for understanding nucleic acid behavior in cell.},

This sequence forms a basket-type intramolecular G-quadruplex with only two G-tetrads but multiple-layer capping structures formed by loop residues. While it is shown that this structure can only be detected in the specifically truncated telomeric sequences without any 5'-flanking residues, our results suggest that this two-G-tetrad conformation is likely to be an intermediate form of the interconversion of different telomeric G-quadruplex conformations.},

abstract = {Sharply bent DNA is essential for gene regulation in prokaryotes and is a major feature of eukaryotic nucleosomes and viruses. The explanation normally given for these phenomena is that specific proteins sharply bend DNA by application of large forces, while the DNA follows despite its intrinsic inflexibility. Here we show that DNAs that are 94 bp in length-comparable to sharply looped DNAs in vivo-spontaneously bend into circles. Proteins can enhance the stability of such loops, but the loops occur spontaneously even in naked DNA. Random DNA sequences cyclize 10(2)-10(4) times more easily than predicted from current theories of DNA bending, while DNA sequences that position nucleosomes cyclize up to 10(5) times more easily. These unexpected results establish DNA as an active participant in the formation of looped regulatory complexes in vivo, and they point to a need for new theories of DNA bending.},

abstract = {The influence of single-stranded nicks and gaps on the flexibility of DNA has been investigated by subjecting to gel electrophoresis sets of molecules containing single-stranded regions of defined position and length. The DNA molecules were produced by ligating together synthetic oligomers that contained either nicks or single-stranded gaps of 1-4 nucleotides; the oligomer repeat lengths were 20, 21, 22, 23, or 26 bp, in order to produce nicks or gaps that were either in- or out-of-phase with the helix repeat of DNA. Nick-containing DNA molecules displayed nearly normal electrophoretic behavior, with maximum reductions in gel mobility (41 degrees C; 12\% polyacrylamide gels) of approximately 10\% for 230-bp molecules containing 10 nicks. In contrast, molecules containing gaps of 2-4 nucleotides demonstrated dramatic reductions in mobility, approaching one-half of the values of their full-duplex counterparts; molecules containing 1-nucleotide gaps displayed intermediate behavior. The observed (relative) mobilities of molecules containing gaps of more than 1 nucleotide were remarkably insensitive to temperature and to the presence of magnesium ions in the electrophoresis buffer. The central conclusion of the current study is that single-stranded gaps represent points of swivel-like character, whereas nicks retain much of the rigid character of double-helical DNA.},

abstract = {The analysis of human genetic variations such as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) has great applications in genome-wide association studies of complex genetic traits. We have developed an SNP genotyping method based on the primer extension assay with fluorescence quenching as the detection. The template-directed dye-terminator incorporation with fluorescence quenching detection (FQ-TDI) assay is based on the observation that the intensity of fluorescent dye R110- and R6G-labeled acycloterminators is universally quenched once they are incorporated onto a DNA oligonucleotide primer. By comparing the rate of fluorescence quenching of the two allelic dyes in real time, we have extended this method for allele frequency estimation of SNPs in pooled DNA samples. The kinetic FQ-TDI assay is highly accurate and reproducible both in genotyping and in allele frequency estimation. Allele frequencies estimated by the kinetic FQ-TDI assay correlated well with known allele frequencies, with an r(2) value of 0.993. Applying this strategy to large-scale studies will greatly reduce the time and cost for genotyping hundreds and thousands of SNP markers between affected and control populations.},

@article{Chung2010,
abstract = {F\"{o}rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) efficiency distributions in single-molecule experiments contain both structural and dynamical information. Extraction of this information from these distributions requires a careful analysis of contributions from dye photophysics. To investigate how mechanisms other than FRET affect the distributions obtained by counting donor and acceptor photons, we have measured single-molecule fluorescence trajectories of a small alpha/beta protein, i.e., protein GB1, undergoing two-state, folding/unfolding transitions. Alexa 488 donor and Alexa 594 acceptor dyes were attached to cysteines at positions 10 and 57 to yield two isomers-donor(10)/acceptor(57) and donor(57)/acceptor(10)-which could not be separated in the purification. The protein was immobilized via binding of a histidine tag added to a linker sequence at the N-terminus to cupric ions embedded in a polyethylene-glycol-coated glass surface. The distribution of FRET efficiencies assembled from the trajectories is complex with widths for the individual peaks in large excess of that caused by shot noise. Most of this complexity can be explained by two interfering photophysical effects-a photoinduced red shift of the donor dye and differences in the quantum yield of the acceptor dye for the two isomers resulting from differences in quenching rate by the cupric ion. Measurements of steady-state polarization, calculation of the donor-acceptor cross-correlation function from photon trajectories, and comparison of the single molecule and ensemble kinetics all indicate that conformational distributions and dynamics do not contribute to the complexity.},

We apply our method to real photon arrival data from recent single-molecule biophysical experiments, investigating proteins' conformational dynamics.

The device directly accepts transistor-transistor logic (TTL) signals from two photon counting detectors and calculates two auto- or cross-correlation curves in real time. Test measurements demonstrate that the performance of our correlator is comparable with the current generation of commercial devices. The sensitivity of the optical setup is identical or even superior to current commercial devices. The FPGA design and the optical setup both allow for a straightforward extension to multi-color applications. This inexpensive and compact solution with a very good performance can serve as a versatile platform for uses in education, applied sciences, and basic research.},

abstract = {To obtain quantitative information on the size and dynamics of unfolded proteins we combined single-molecule lifetime and intensity FRET measurements with molecular simulations. We compared the unfolded states of the 64-residue, alpha/beta protein L and the 66-residue, all-beta cold-shock protein CspTm. The average radius of gyration (Rg) calculated from FRET data on freely diffusing molecules was identical for the two unfolded proteins at guanidinium chloride concentrations >3 M, and the FRET-derived Rg of protein L agreed well with the Rg previously measured by equilibrium small-angle x-ray scattering. As the denaturant concentration was lowered, the mean FRET efficiency of the unfolded subpopulation increased, signaling collapse of the polypeptide chain, with protein L being slightly more compact than CspTm. A decrease in Rg with decreasing denaturant was also observed in all-atom molecular dynamics calculations in explicit water/urea solvent, and Langevin simulations of a simplified representation of the polypeptide suggest that collapse can result from either increased interresidue attraction or decreased excluded volume. In contrast to both the FRET and simulation results, previous time-resolved small-angle x-ray scattering experiments showed no collapse for protein L. Analysis of the donor fluorescence decay of the unfolded subpopulation of both proteins gives information about the end-to-end chain distribution and suggests that chain dynamics is slow compared with the donor life-time of approximately 2 ns, whereas the bin-size independence of the small excess width above the shot noise for the FRET efficiency distributions may result from incomplete conformational averaging on even the 1-ms time scale.},

abstract = {DNA topoisomerases are enzymes that disentangle the topological problems that arise in double-stranded DNA. Many of these can be solved by the generation of either single or double strand breaks. However, where there is a clear requirement to alter DNA topology by introducing transient double strand breaks, only DNA topoisomerase II (TOP2) can carry out this reaction. Extensive biochemical and structural studies have provided detailed models of how TOP2 alters DNA structure, and recent molecular studies have greatly expanded knowledge of the biological contexts in which TOP2 functions, such as DNA replication, transcription and chromosome segregation -- processes that are essential for preventing tumorigenesis.},

@article{Jo2004,
abstract = {For complex biological systems, conventional analysis of fluorescence intensity decay in terms of discrete exponential components cannot readily provide a true representation of the underlying fluorescence dynamics. We investigate an alternative nonparametric method for the analysis of time-resolved fluorescence data from biochemical and biological systems based on the expansion of fluorescence decay in a discrete Laguerre basis. We report that a unique Laguerre expansion can be found for fluorescence intensity decays of arbitrary form with convergence to a correct solution significantly faster than conventional multiexponential approximation methods. The Laguerre expansion coefficients are shown to be highly correlated with intrinsic fluorescence lifetimes and allow direct characterization of the fluorescence dynamics. A novel method for prediction of concentrations in mixtures of biochemical components using these coefficients is developed and successfully tested (prediction error <2\%) using data from different mixtures of fluorescence lifetime standards. These findings suggest that the use of Laguerre expansion coefficients is a fast approach for the characterization and discrimination of complex biological systems such as tissues and cells, and that the method has potential for applications of fluorescence lifetime techniques to tissue diagnostics and imaging microscopy of living cells.},

@article{Lannan2012,
abstract = {Structures formed by human telomere sequence (HTS) DNA are of interest due to the implication of telomeres in the aging process and cancer. We present studies of HTS DNA folding in an anhydrous, high viscosity deep eutectic solvent (DES) comprised of choline choride and urea. In this solvent, the HTS DNA forms a G-quadruplex with the parallel-stranded ("propeller") fold, consistent with observations that reduced water activity favors the parallel fold, whereas alternative folds are favored at high water activity. Surprisingly, adoption of the parallel structure by HTS DNA in the DES, after thermal denaturation and quick cooling to room temperature, requires several months, as opposed to less than 2 min in an aqueous solution. This extended folding time in the DES is, in part, due to HTS DNA becoming kinetically trapped in a folded state that is apparently not accessed in lower viscosity solvents. A comparison of times required for the G-quadruplex to convert from its aqueous-preferred folded state to its parallel fold also reveals a dependence on solvent viscosity that is consistent with Kramers rate theory, which predicts that diffusion-controlled transitions will slow proportionally with solvent friction. These results provide an enhanced view of a G-quadruplex folding funnel and highlight the necessity to consider solvent viscosity in studies of G-quadruplex formation in vitro and in vivo. Additionally, the solvents and analyses presented here should prove valuable for understanding the folding of many other nucleic acids and potentially have applications in DNA-based nanotechnology where time-dependent structures are desired.},
