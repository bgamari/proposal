# Thesis

While it seems that the geometry of the bulge has been well
characterized by @Wozniak2008, there may still be room viewing the
bulge as a way to probe the local flexibility properties of
ssDNA (somewhat as done by @Forties2009). Salt type and concetration
depedence may be the most relevant and accessible parameters to
characterize. Given that we lack Seidel's setup, an approach along the
lines of @chen2012 might be most feasible, using FRET in conjunction
with SAXS.

An approach for examining gap flexibility would be to look at
rotational anisotropy of a well fixed terminal fluorophore. This is
similar to the measurement done by @Mills1999 with transient electric
birefringence (TEB).

# Summary

## Flexibility on long length scales

The flexibility characteristics of long DNA (kilobases) have been
characterized largely using force extension experiments using optical
and magnetic tweezers[@Bustamante2000, @Bustamante2003]

## Enhanced flexibility of dsDNA at short length scales

Cloutier's 2004 cyclization experiments[@Cloutier2004] first proposed
that short (~100 bp) dsDNA would cyclize between $10^2$ and $10^4$
times more readily than the wormlike chain model would
predict. Moreover, they reported an interesting base sequence
dependence.

This finding spurred a number of experimental and theoretical efforts,
with @Du2005 eventually reporting that their own cyclization
experiments disagreed with Cloutier's findings, showing that even
these small systems were well described by the WLC.

 * In reference to @Cloutier2004, $L=100 bp$

 * Blame discrepancy on Cloutier's high ligase concentration
    * For $j$ factor to be realistic, "the rate of ligation of joined
      cohesive ends must be much slower than the rate of their
      dissociation"

      fragments, they failed to show this "for the same cohesive ends
